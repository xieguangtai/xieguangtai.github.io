    <p><strong>1.    Entanglement Properties of Localized States in 1D Topological Quantum Walks</strong><br>
C. M. Chandrashekar, H. Obuse, Th. Busch<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.00436">http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.00436</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
The symmetries associated with discrete-time quantum walks (DTQWs) and the flexibilities in controlling their dynamical parameters allow to create a large number of topological phases. An interface in position space, which separates two regions with different topological numbers, can, for example, be effectively modelled using different coin parameters for the walk on either side of the interface. Depending on the neighbouring numbers, this can lead to localized states in one-dimensional configurations and here we carry out a detailed study into the strength of such localized states. We show that it can be related to the amount of entanglement created by the walks, with minima appearing for strong localizations. This feature also persists in the presence of small amounts of $\sigma_x$ (bit flip) noise.

<p><strong>2.    From open quantum walks to unitary quantum walks</strong><br>
Chaobin Liu<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.01680">http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.01680</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We present an idea to convert to a unitary quantum walk any open quantum walk which is defined on lattices as well as on finite graphs. This approach generalizes to the domain of open quantum walks (or quantum Markov chains) the framework introduced by Szegedy for quantizing Markov chains. For the unitary quantum walks formulated in this article, we define the probability and the mean probability of finding the walk at a node, then derive the asymptotic mean probability.

<p><strong>3.    Bulk-edge correspondence of one-dimensional quantum walks</strong><br>
C. Cedzich, F. A. Gr��nbaum, C. Stahl, L. Vel��zquez, A. H. Werner, R. F. Werner<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.02592">http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.02592</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We outline a theory of symmetry protected topological phases of one-dimensional quantum walks. We assume spectral gaps around the symmetry-distinguished points +1 and -1, in which only discrete eigenvalues are allowed. The phase classification by integer or binary indices extends the classification known for translation invariant systems in terms of their band structure. However, our theory requires no translation invariance whatsoever, and the indices we define in this general setting are invariant under arbitrary symmetric local perturbations, even those that cannot be continuously contracted to the identity. More precisely we define two indices for every walk, characterizing the behavior far to the right and far to the left, respectively. Their sum is a lower bound on the number of eigenstates at +1 and -1. For a translation invariant system the indices add up to zero, so one of them already characterizes the phase. By joining two bulk phases with different indices we get a walk in which the right and left indices no longer cancel, so the theory predicts bound states at +1 or -1. This is a rigorous statement of bulk-edge correspondence. The results also apply to the Hamiltonian case with a single gap at zero.

<p><strong>4.    Hyperentanglement concentration for time-bin and polarization hyperentangled photons</strong><br>
Xihan Li, Shohini Ghose<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.02891">http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.02891</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We present two hyperentanglement concentration schemes for two-photon states that are partially entangled in the polarization and time-bin degrees of freedom. The first scheme distills a maximally hyperentangled state from two identical less-entangled states with unknown parameters via the Schmidt projection method. The other scheme can be used to concentrate an initial state with known parameters, and requires only one copy of the initial state for the concentration process. Both these two protocols can be generalized to concentrate N-photon hyperentangled Greenberger- Horne-Zeilinger states that are simultaneously entangled in the polarization and time-bin degrees of freedom. Our schemes require only linear optics and are feasible with current technology. Using the time-bin degree of freedom rather than the spatial mode degree of freedom can provide savings in quantum resources, which makes our schemes practical and useful for long-distance quantum communication.

<p><strong>5.    Perfect wave-packet splitting and reconstruction in a one-dimensional lattice</strong><br>
Leonardo Banchi, Enrico Compagno, Sougato Bose<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.03061">http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.03061</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
Particle delocalization is a common feature of quantum random walks in arbitrary lattices. However, in the typical scenario a particle spreads over multiple sites and its evolution is not directly useful for controlled quantum interferometry, as may be required for technological applications. In this paper we devise a strategy to perfectly split the wave-packet of an incoming particle into two components, each propagating in opposite directions, which reconstruct the shape of the initial wavefunction after a particular time $t^<em>$. Therefore, a particle in a delta-like initial state becomes exactly delocalized between two distant sites after $t^</em>$. We find the mathematical conditions to achieve the perfect splitting which are satisfied by viable example Hamiltonians with static site-dependent interaction strengths. Our results pave the way for the generation of peculiar many-body interference patterns in a many-site atomic chain (like the Hanbury Brown and Twiss and quantum Talbot effects) as well as for the distribution of entanglement between remote sites. Thus, as for the case of perfect state transfer, the perfect wave-packet splitting can be a new tool for varied applications.

<p><strong>6.    Transport of quantum excitations via local and nonlocal fluctuations</strong><br>
M. Zhang, Tony E. Lee, H. R. Sadeghpour<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.03328">http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.03328</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
In quantum systems, one usually seeks to minimize dephasing noise and disorder. The efficiency of transport in a quantum system is usually degraded by the presence of noise and disorder. However, it has been shown that the combination of the two can lead to significantly more efficiency than each by itself. Here, we consider how the addition of nonlocal noise, in the form of incoherent hopping, affects the transport efficiency. We show that incoherent hopping introduces additional local extrema in the efficiency function and investigate the crossover from a quantum random walk to a classical random walk.

<p><strong>7.    Single-point position and transition defects in continuous time quantum walks</strong><br>
Zhi-Jian Li, J. B. Wang<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.04289">http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.04289</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We present a detailed analysis of continuous time quantum walks (CTQW) with both position and transition defects defined at a single point in the line. Analytical solutions of both traveling waves or bound states are obtained, which provide valuable insight into the dynamics of CTQW. The number of bound states is found to be critically dependent on the defect parameters, and the localized probability peaks can be readily obtained by projecting the CTQW wavefunction on to these bound states. The interference between two bound states are also observed in the case of a transition defect. The spreading of CTQW probability over the line can be finely tuned by varying the position and transition defect parameters, offering the possibility of precision quantum control of the system.

<p><strong>8.    Grover Search with Lackadaisical Quantum Walks</strong><br>
Thomas G. Wong<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.04567">http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.04567</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
The lazy random walk, where the walker has some probability of staying put, is a useful tool in classical algorithms. We propose a quantum analogue, the lackadaisical quantum walk, where each vertex is given $l$ self-loops, and we investigate its effects on Grover&#39;s algorithm when formulated as search for a marked vertex on the complete graph of $N$ vertices. For the discrete-time quantum walk using the phase flip coin, adding a self-loop to each vertex boosts the success probability from 1/2 to 1. Additional self-loops, however, decrease the success probability. Using instead the Ambainis, Kempe, and Rivosh (2005) coin, adding self-loops simply slows down the search. These coins also differ in that the first is faster than classical when $l$ scales less than $N$, while the second requires that $l$ scale less than $N^2$. Finally, continuous-time quantum walks differ from both of these discrete-time examples---the self-loops make no difference at all. These behaviors generalize to multiple marked vertices.

<p><strong>9.    Quantum Search with Multiple Walk Steps per Oracle Query</strong><br>
Thomas G. Wong, Andris Ambainis<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.04792">http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.04792</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We identify a key difference between discrete- and continuous-time quantum walks in search, that the former is typically restricted to one walk step per oracle query, whereas the latter can take multiple walk steps per oracle query while only counting query time. As a result, we show that continuous-time quantum walks can outperform their discrete-time counterparts, even though both achieve quadratic speedups over their corresponding classical random walks. To provide greater equity, we allow the discrete-time quantum walk to also take multiple walk steps per oracle query while only counting queries. Then it matches the continuous-time algorithm&#39;s runtime, but such that it is a cubic speedup over its corresponding classical random walk. This yields the first example of a greater-than-quadratic speedup for quantum search over its corresponding classical random walk.

<p><strong>10.    Moments of Coinless Quantum Walks on Lattices</strong><br>
Raqueline A. M. Santos, Renato Portugal, Stefan Boettcher<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.06293">http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.06293</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
The properties of the coinless quantum walk model have not been as thoroughly analyzed as those of the coined model. Both evolve in discrete time steps but the former uses a smaller Hilbert space, which is spanned merely by the site basis. Besides, the evolution operator can be obtained using a process of lattice tessellation, which is very appealing. The moments of the probability distribution play an important role in the context of quantum walks. The ballistic behavior of the mean square displacement indicates that quantum-walk-based algorithms are faster than random-walk-based ones. In this paper, we obtain analytical expressions for the moments of the coinless model on $d$-dimensional lattices. The mean square displacement for large times is explicitly calculated for the one- and two-dimensional lattices and, using optimization methods, the parameter values that give the largest spread are calculated and compared with the equivalent ones of the coined model. Although we have employed asymptotic methods, our approximations are accurate even for small numbers of time steps.

<p><strong>11.    A limit law of the return probability for a quantum walk on a hexagonal lattice</strong><br>
Takuya Machida<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.06453">http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.06453</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
A return probability of random walks is one of the interesting subjects. As it is well known, the return probability strongly depends on the structure of the space where the random waker moves. On the other hand, the return probability of quantum walks, which are quantum models corresponding to random walks, has also been investigated to some extend lately. In this paper, we present a limit of the return probability for a discrete-time 3-state quantum walk on a hexagonal lattice.
