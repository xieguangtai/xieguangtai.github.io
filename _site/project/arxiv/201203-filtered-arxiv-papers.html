    <p><strong>1.    Quantum walk on distinguishable non-interacting many-particles and indistinguishable two-particle</strong><br>
C. M. Chandrashekar, Th. Busch<br>
Quantum Information Processing: Volume 11, Issue 5, Page 1287-1299 (2012)<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1203.0785">http://arxiv.org/abs/1203.0785</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We present an investigation of many-particle quantum walks in systems of non-interacting distinguishable particles. Along with a redistribution of the many-particle density profile we show that the collective evolution of the many-particle system resembles the single-particle quantum walk evolution when the number of steps is greater than the number of particles in the system. For non-uniform initial states we show that the quantum walks can be effectively used to separate the basis states of the particle in position space and grouping like state together. We also discuss a two-particle quantum walk on a two- dimensional lattice and demonstrate an evolution leading to the localization of both particles at the center of the lattice. Finally we discuss the outcome of a quantum walk of two indistinguishable particles interacting at some point during the evolution.

<p><strong>2.    Quantum Walks of SU(2)_k Anyons on a Ladder</strong><br>
L. Lehman, D. Ellinas, G.K. Brennen<br>
Journal of Computational and Theoretical Nanoscience, 10, 1634-1643 (2013)<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1203.1999">http://arxiv.org/abs/1203.1999</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We study the effects of braiding interactions on single anyon dynamics using a quantum walk model on a quasi-1-dimensional ladder filled with stationary anyons. The model includes loss of information of the coin and nonlocal fusion degrees of freedom on every second time step, such that the entanglement between the position states and the exponentially growing auxiliary degrees of freedom is lost. The computational complexity of numerical calculations reduces drastically from the fully coherent anyonic quantum walk model, allowing for relatively long simulations for anyons which are spin-1/2 irreps of SU(2)_k Chern-Simons theory. We find that for Abelian anyons, the walk retains the ballistic spreading velocity just like particles with trivial braiding statistics. For non-Abelian anyons, the numerical results indicate that the spreading velocity is linearly dependent on the number of time steps. By approximating the Kraus generators of the time evolution map by circulant matrices, it is shown that the spatial probability distribution for the k=2 walk, corresponding to Ising model anyons, is equal to the classical unbiased random walk distribution.

<p><strong>3.    Search on a Fractal Lattice using a Quantum Random Walk</strong><br>
Apoorva Patel, K. S. Raghunathan<br>
Physical Review A 86 (2012) 012332<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1203.3950">http://arxiv.org/abs/1203.3950</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
The spatial search problem on regular lattice structures in integer number of dimensions $d\geq2$ has been studied extensively, using both coined and coinless quantum walks. The relativistic Dirac operator has been a crucial ingredient in these studies. Here we investigate the spatial search problem on fractals of non-integer dimensions. Although the Dirac operator cannot be defined on a fractal, we construct the quantum walk on a fractal using the flip-flop operator that incorporates a Klein-Gordon mode. We find that the scaling behavior of the spatial search is determined by the spectral (and not the fractal) dimension. Our numerical results have been obtained on the well-known Sierpinski gaskets in two and three dimensions.

<p><strong>4.    Quantum Money from Hidden Subspaces</strong><br>
Scott Aaronson, Paul Christiano<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1203.4740">http://arxiv.org/abs/1203.4740</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
Forty years ago, Wiesner pointed out that quantum mechanics raises the striking possibility of money that cannot be counterfeited according to the laws of physics. We propose the first quantum money scheme that is (1) public-key, meaning that anyone can verify a banknote as genuine, not only the bank that printed it, and (2) cryptographically secure, under a &quot;classical&quot; hardness assumption that has nothing to do with quantum money. Our scheme is based on hidden subspaces, encoded as the zero-sets of random multivariate polynomials. A main technical advance is to show that the &quot;black-box&quot; version of our scheme, where the polynomials are replaced by classical oracles, is unconditionally secure. Previously, such a result had only been known relative to a quantum oracle (and even there, the proof was never published). Even in Wiesner&#39;s original setting -- quantum money that can only be verified by the bank -- we are able to use our techniques to patch a major security hole in Wiesner&#39;s scheme. We give the first private-key quantum money scheme that allows unlimited verifications and that remains unconditionally secure, even if the counterfeiter can interact adaptively with the bank. Our money scheme is simpler than previous public-key quantum money schemes, including a knot-based scheme of Farhi et al. The verifier needs to perform only two tests, one in the standard basis and one in the Hadamard basis -- matching the original intuition for quantum money, based on the existence of complementary observables. Our security proofs use a new variant of Ambainis&#39;s quantum adversary method, and several other tools that might be of independent interest.

<p><strong>5.    A quantum walk with a delocalized initial state: contribution from a coin-flip operator</strong><br>
Takuya Machida<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1203.5396">http://arxiv.org/abs/1203.5396</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
A unit evolution step of discrete-time quantum walks is determined by both a coin-flip operator and a position-shift operator. The behavior of quantum walkers after many steps delicately depends on the coin-flip operator and an initial condition of the walk. To get the behavior, a lot of long-time limit distributions for the quantum walks starting with a localized initial state have been derived. In the present paper, we compute limit distributions of a 2-state quantum walk with a delocalized initial state, not a localized initial state, and discuss how the walker depends on the coin-flip operator. The initial state induced from the Fourier series expansion, which is called the $(\alpha,\beta)$ delocalized initial state in this paper, provides different limit density functions from the ones of the quantum walk with a localized initial state.

<p><strong>6.    Non-Markovian Decoherent Quantum Walks</strong><br>
Peng Xue, Yongsheng Zhang<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1203.5630">http://arxiv.org/abs/1203.5630</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
Quantum walk acts obviously different from its classical counterpart, but decoherence will lessen and close the gap between them. To understand this process, it is necessary to investigate the evolution of quantum walk under different situation of decoherence. In this article, we study a non-Markovian decoherent quantum walk on a line. In the short time regime, the behavior of the walk deviates from both idea quantum walks and classical random walks. The position variance as a measure of quantum walk starts oscillating from the first several steps and tends to be linear on time and showing a diffusive spread in the long time limit, which is caused by the non-Markovian dephasing affecting on quantum correlations between quantum walker and his coin. We also study both quantum discord and measurement-induced disturbance as measures of quantum correlations and observe that both of them oscillate in the short time regime and tend to be zero in the long time limit. Therefore quantum walk with non-Markovian decoherence tends to diffusive spreading behavior in the long time limit, while in the short time regime it oscillates between a ballistic and diffusive spreading behavior, and the quantum correlation collapses and revivals due to the memory effect.

<p><strong>7.    Implementation of multi-walker quantum walks with cavity grid</strong><br>
Peng Xue<br>
Journal of Computational and Theoretical Nanoscience 10, 1 (2013)<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1203.5962">http://arxiv.org/abs/1203.5962</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We show how multi-walker quantum walks can be implemented in a quantum quincunx created via cavity quantum electrodynamics. The implementation of a quantum walk with a multi-walker opens up the interesting possibility to introduce entanglement and more advanced walks. With different coin tosses and initial states the multi-walker quantum walk shows different probability distributions which deviate strongly from the classical random walks with quadratic enhanced spreadings and localization effects. By introducing decoherence, the transition from quantum walks to the classical versions is observed. We introduce the average fidelity decay as a signature to investigate the decoherence-induced irreversibility of quantum walks.

<p><strong>8.    Ito&#39;s formula for the discrete-time quantum walk in two dimensions</strong><br>
Clement Ampadu<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1203.0935">http://arxiv.org/abs/1203.0935</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
Following [Konno, arXiv:1112.4335], it is natural to ask: What is the Ito&#39;s formula for the discrete time quantum walk on a graph different than Z, the set of integers? In this paper we answer the question for the discrete time quantum walk on Z^2, the square lattice.

<p><strong>9.    Levinson&#39;s theorem for graphs II</strong><br>
Andrew M. Childs, David Gosset<br>
Journal of Mathematical Physics 53, 102207 (2012)<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1203.6557">http://arxiv.org/abs/1203.6557</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We prove Levinson&#39;s theorem for scattering on an (m+n)-vertex graph with n semi-infinite paths each attached to a different vertex, generalizing a previous result for the case n=1. This theorem counts the number of bound states in terms of the winding of the determinant of the S-matrix. We also provide a proof that the bound states and incoming scattering states of the Hamiltonian together form a complete basis for the Hilbert space, generalizing another result for the case n=1.
