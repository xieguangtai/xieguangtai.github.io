    <p><strong>1.    Deterministic generation of an on-demand Fock state</strong><br>
Keyu Xia, Gavin K. Brennen, Demosthenes Ellinas, Jason Twamley<br>
Optics Express, Vol. 20, Issue 24, pp. 27198-27211 (2012)<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1209.0858">http://arxiv.org/abs/1209.0858</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We theoretically study the deterministic generation of photon Fock states on-demand using a protocol based on a Jaynes Cummings quantum random walk which includes damping. We then show how each of the steps of this protocol can be implemented in a low temperature solid-state quantum system with a Nitrogen-Vacancy centre in a nano-diamond coupled to a nearby high-Q optical cavity. By controlling the coupling duration between the NV and the cavity via the application of a time dependent Stark shift, and by increasing the decay rate of the NV via stimulated emission depletion (STED) a Fock state with high photon number can be generated on-demand. Our setup can be integrated on a chip and can be accurately controlled.

<p><strong>2.    Coherent Time Evolution and Boundary Conditions of Two-Photon Quantum Walks</strong><br>
Jasmin D. A. Meinecke, Konstantinos Poulios, Alberto Politi, Jonathan C. F. Matthews, Alberto Peruzzo, Nur Ismail, Kerstin W?rhoff, Jeremy L. O&#39;Brien, Mark G. Thompson<br>
Phys. Rev. A 88, 012308 (2013)<br>

<blockquote>
<p>
Multi-photon quantum walks in integrated optics are an attractive controlled quantum system, that can mimic less readily accessible quantum systems and exhibit behavior that cannot in general be accurately replicated by classical light without an exponential overhead in resources. The ability to observe time evolution of such systems is important for characterising multi-particle quantum dynamics---notably this includes the effects of boundary conditions for walks in spaces of finite size. Here we demonstrate the coherent evolution of quantum walks of two indistinguishable photons using planar arrays of 21 evanescently coupled waveguides fabricated in silicon oxynitride technology. We compare three time evolutions, that follow closely a model assuming unitary evolution, corresponding to three different lengths of the array---in each case we observe quantum interference features that violate classical predictions. The longest array includes reflecting boundary conditions.

<p><strong>3.    Quantum Walks on Sierpinski Gaskets</strong><br>
Pedro Carlos S. Lara, Renato Portugal, Stefan Boettcher<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1209.2095">http://arxiv.org/abs/1209.2095</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We analyze discrete-time quantum walks on Sierpinski gaskets using a flip-flop shift operator with the Grover coin. We obtain the scaling of two important physical quantities: the mean-square displacement and the mixing time as function of the number of points. The Sierpinski gasket is a fractal that lacks translational invariance and the results differ from those described in the literature for ordinary lattices. We find that the displacement varies with the initial location. Averaged over all initial locations, our simulation obtain an exponent very similar to classical diffusion.

<p><strong>4.    Quantum Parrondo&#39;s games using quantum walks</strong><br>
Adrian P. Flitney<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1209.2252">http://arxiv.org/abs/1209.2252</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We study a quantum walk in one-dimension using two different &quot;coin&quot; operators. By mixing two operators, both of which give a biased walk with negative expectation value for the walker position, it is possible to reverse the bias through interference effects. This effect is analogous to that in Parrondo&#39;s games, where alternating two losing (gambling) games can produce a winning game. The walker bias is produced by introducing a phase factor into the coin operator, with two different phase factors giving games $A$ and $B$. We give the range of phases for which the Parrondo effect can be obtained with $A$ and $B$ played alternately or in other (repeated) deterministic sequences. The effect is transitory. For sufficiently large times the original bias resumes.

<p><strong>5.    Noise-enhanced quantum transport on a closed loop using quantum walks</strong><br>
C. M. Chandrashekar, Th. Busch<br>
Quantum Information Processing, Volume 13, Issue 6, Pages 1313-1329 (2014)<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1209.3144">http://arxiv.org/abs/1209.3144</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We study the effect of noise on the transport of a quantum state from a closed loop of $n-$sites with one of the sites as a sink. Using a discrete-time quantum walk dynamics, we demonstrate that the transport efficiency can be enhanced with noise when the number of sites in the loop is small and reduced when the number of sites in the loop grows. By using the concept of measurement induced disturbance we identify the regimes in which genuine quantum effects are responsible for the enhanced transport.

<p><strong>6.    Controlling and reversing the transition from classical diffusive to quantum ballistic transport in a quantum walk by driving the coin</strong><br>
Peng Xue, Barry C. Sanders<br>
Physical Review A 87(2), 022334 (22 Feb 2013)<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1209.3376">http://arxiv.org/abs/1209.3376</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We show that the standard quantum-walk quantum-to-classical transition, characterized by ballistic-to-diffusive spreading of the walker&#39;s position, can be controlled by externally modulating the coin state. We illustrate by showing an oscillation between classical diffusive and quantum ballistic spreading using numerical and asymptotically exact closed-form solutions, and we prove that the walker is in a controllable incoherent mixture of classical and quantum walks with a reversible quantum-to-classical transition.

<p><strong>7.    Superdiffusivity of quantum walks: A Feynman sum-over-paths description</strong><br>
F. M. Andrade, M. G. E. da Luz<br>
Phys. Rev A 86, 042309 (2012)<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1209.4953">http://arxiv.org/abs/1209.4953</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
Quantum walks constitute important tools in different applications, especially in quantum algorithms. To a great extent their usefulness is due to unusual diffusive features, allowing much faster spreading than their classical counterparts. Such behavior, although frequently credited to intrinsic quantum interference, usually is not completely characterized. Using a recently developed Green&#39;s function approach [Phys. Rev. A {\bf 84}, 042343 (2011)], here it is described -- in a rather general way -- the problem dynamics in terms of a true sum over paths history a la Feynman. It allows one to explicit identify interference effects and also to explain the emergence of superdiffusivity. The present analysis has the potential to help in designing quantum walks with distinct transport properties.

<p><strong>8.    Formal languages analysed by quantum walks</strong><br>
Katie Barr, Viv Kendon<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1209.5238">http://arxiv.org/abs/1209.5238</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
Discrete time quantum walks are known to be universal for quantum computation. This has been proven by showing that they can simulate a universal gate set. In this paper we examine computation in terms of language acceptance and present two ways in which discrete time quantum walks can accept some languages with certainty. These walks can take quantum as well as classical inputs, and we show that when the input is quantum, the walks can be interpreted as performing state discrimination.

<p><strong>9.    Generation of spatially pure photon pairs in a multimode nonlinear waveguide using intermodal dispersion</strong><br>
Michal Karpinski, Czeslaw Radzewicz, Konrad Banaszek<br>
Proc. SPIE 8518, Quantum Communications and Quantum Imaging X, 85180J (2012)<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1209.5349">http://arxiv.org/abs/1209.5349</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We present experimental realization of type-II spontaneous parametric down-conversion in a periodically poled potassium titanyl phosphate (KTiOPO4) nonlinear waveguide. We demonstrate that by careful exploitation of intermodal dispersion in the waveguide it is feasible to produce photon pairs in well defined transverse modes without any additional spatial filtering at the output. Spatial characteristics is verified by measurements of the M2 beam quality factors. We also prepared a postselected polarization-entangled two-photon state shown to violate Bell&#39;s inequality. Similar techniques based on intermodal dispersion can be used to generate spatial entanglement and hyperentanglement.

<p><strong>10.    Supersymmetric Quantum Mechanics, Engineered Hierarchies of Integrable Potentials, and the Generalised Laguerre Polynomials</strong><br>
Daddy Balondo Iyela, Jan Govaerts, M. Norbert Hounkonnou<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1209.0182">http://arxiv.org/abs/1209.0182</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
Within the context of Supersymmetric Quantum Mechanics and its related hierarchies of integrable quantum Hamiltonians and potentials, a general programme is outlined and applied to its first two simplest illustrations. Going beyond the usual restriction of shape invariance for intertwined potentials, it is suggested to require a similar relation for Hamiltonians in the hierarchy separated by an arbitrary number of levels, N. By requiring further that these two Hamiltonians be in fact identical up to an overall shift in energy, a periodic structure is installed in the hierarchy of quantum systems which should allow for its solution. Specific classes of orthogonal polynomials characteristic of such periodic hierarchies are thereby generated, while the methods of Supersymmetric Quantum Mechanics then lead to generalised Rodrigues formulae and recursion relations for such polynomials. The approach also offers the practical prospect of quantum modelling through the engineering of quantum potentials from experimental energy spectra. In this paper these ideas are presented and solved explicitly for the cases N=1 and N=2. The latter case is related to the generalised Laguerre polynomials, for which indeed new results are thereby obtained. At the same time new classes of integrable quantum potentials which generalise that of the harmonic oscillator and which are characterised by two arbitrary energy gaps are identified, for which a complete solution is achieved algebraically.

<p><strong>11.    Limit theorems for open quantum random walks</strong><br>
Norio Konno, Hyun Jae Yoo<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1209.1419">http://arxiv.org/abs/1209.1419</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We consider the limit distributions of open quantum random walks on one-dimensional lattice space. We introduce a dual process to the original quantum walk process, which is quite similar to the relation of Schr\&quot;odinger-Heisenberg representation in quantum mechanics. By this, we can compute the distribution of the open quantum random walks concretely for many examples and thereby we can also obtain the limit distributions of them. In particular, it is possible to get rid of the initial state when we consider the evolution of the walk, it appears only in the last step of the computation.
