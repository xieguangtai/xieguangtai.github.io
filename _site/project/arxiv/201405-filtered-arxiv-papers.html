    <p><strong>1.    Quantum Recursion and Second Quantisation</strong><br>
Mingsheng Ying<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.4443">http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.4443</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
This paper introduces a new notion of quantum recursion of which the control flow of the computation is quantum rather than classical as in the notions of recursion considered in the previous studies of quantum programming. A typical example is recursive quantum walks, which are obtained by slightly modifying the construction of the ordinary quantum walks. The operational and denotational semantics of quantum recursions are defined by employing the second quantisation method, and they are proved to be equivalent.

<p><strong>2.    Transport properties of continuous-time quantum walks on Sierpinski fractals</strong><br>
Zolt��n Dar��zs, Anastasiia Anishchenko, Tam��s Kiss, Alexander Blumen, Oliver M��lken<br>
Phys. Rev. E 90, 032113 (2014)<br>

<blockquote>
<p>
We model quantum transport, described by continuous-time quantum walks (CTQW), on deterministic Sierpinski fractals, differentiating between Sierpinski gaskets and Sierpinski carpets, along with their dual structures. The transport efficiencies are defined in terms of the exact and the average return probabilities, as well as by the mean survival probability when absorbing traps are present. In the case of gaskets, localization can be identified already for small networks (generations). For carpets, our numerical results indicate a trend towards localization, but only for relatively large structures. The comparison of gaskets and carpets further implies that, distinct from the corresponding classical continuous-time random walk, the spectral dimension does not fully determine the evolution of the CTQW.

<blockquote>
<p>
Wigner separated the possible types of symmetries in quantum theory into those symmetries that are unitary and those that are antiunitary. Unitary symmetries have been well studied whereas antiunitary symmetries and the physical implications associated with time-reversal symmetry breaking have had little influence on quantum information science. Here we develop a quantum circuits version of time-reversal symmetry theory, classifying time-symmetric and time-asymmetric Hamiltonians and circuits in terms of their underlying network elements and geometric structures. These results reveal that many of the typical quantum circuit networks found across the field of quantum information science exhibit time-asymmetry. We then experimentally implement the most fundamental time-reversal asymmetric process, applying local gates in an otherwise time-symmetric circuit to induce time-reversal asymmetry and thereby achieve (i) directional biasing in the transition probability between basis states, (ii) the enhancement of and (iii) the suppression of these transport probabilities. Our results imply that the physical effect of time-symmetry breaking plays an essential role in coherent transport and its control represents an omnipresent yet essentially untapped resource in quantum transport science.

<p><strong>4.    Perfect state transfer and efficient quantum routing: a discrete-time quantum walk approach</strong><br>
Xiang Zhan, Hao Qin, Zhi-hao Bian, Jian Li, Peng Xue<br>
Phys. Rev. A 90, 012331 (2014)<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.6422">http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.6422</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We show a perfect state transfer of an arbitrary unknown two-qubit state can be achieved via a discrete-time quantum walk with various settings of coin flippings, and extend this method to distribution of an arbitrary unknown multi-qubit entangled state between every pair of sites in the multi-dimensional network. Furthermore, we study the routing of quantum information on this network in a quantum walk architecture, which can be used as quantum information processors to communicate between separated qubits.

<p><strong>5.    Controlling quantum walks with coin eigenstates</strong><br>
Martin Stefanak, Igor Jex<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.6504">http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.6504</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
The control of quantum walk is made particularly transparent when the initial state is expressed in terms of the eigenstates of the coin operator. We show that the group-velocity density acquires a much simpler form when expressed in this basis. This allows us to obtain a much deeper understanding of the role of the initial coin state on the dynamics of quantum walks and control it. We find that the eigenvectors of the coin result in an extremal regime of a quantum walk. The approach is illustrated on two examples of quantum walks on a line.

<p><strong>6.    Limit distributions of three-state quantum walks: the role of coin eigenstates</strong><br>
Martin Stefanak, Iva Bezdekova, Igor Jex<br>
Phys. Rev. A 90, 012342 (2014)<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.7146">http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.7146</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We analyze two families of three-state quantum walks which show the localization effect. We focus on the role of the initial coin state and its coherence in controlling the properties of the quantum walk. In particular, we show that the description of the walk simplifies considerably when the initial coin state is decomposed in the basis formed by the eigenvectors of the coin operator. This allows us to express the limit distributions in a much more convenient form. Consequently, striking features which are hidden in the standard basis description are easily identified. Moreover, the dependence of moments of the position distribution on the initial coin state can be analyzed in full detail. In particular, we find that in the eigenvector basis the even moments and the localization probability at the origin depend only on incoherent combination of probabilities. In contrast, odd moments and localization outside the origin are affected by the coherence of the initial coin state.

<p><strong>7.    Quantum state revivals in quantum walks on cycles</strong><br>
Phillip R. Dukes<br>
Results in Physics Vol. 4, 2014, pgs. 189-197<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.7345">http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.7345</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
Recurrence in the classical random walk is well known and described by the P\&#39;olya number. For quantum walks, recurrence is similarly understood in terms of the probability of a localized quantum walker to return to its origin. Under certain circumstances the quantum walker may also return to an arbitrary initial quantum state in a finite number of steps. Quantum state revivals in quantum walks on circles using coin operators which are constant in time and uniform across the path have been described before but only incompletely. In this paper we find the general conditions for which full-quantum state revival will occur.

<p><strong>8.    History Dependent Quantum Random Walks as Quantum Lattice Gas Automata</strong><br>
Asif Shakeel, David A. Meyer, Peter J. Love<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.0972">http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.0972</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
Quantum Random Walks (QRW) were first defined as one-particle sectors of Quantum Lattice Gas Automata (QLGA). Recently, they have been generalized to include history dependence, either on previous coin (internal, i.e., spin or velocity) states or on previous position states. These models have the goal of studying the transition to classicality, or more generally, changes in the performance of quantum walks in algorithmic applications. We show that several history dependent QRW can be identified as one-particle sectors of QLGA. This provides a unifying conceptual framework for these models in which the extra degrees of freedom required to store the history information arise naturally as geometrical degrees of freedom on the lattice.

<p><strong>9.    Trapping and spreading properties of quantum walk in homological structure</strong><br>
Takuya Machida, Etsuo Segawa<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.1487">http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.1487</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We attempt to extract a homological structure of two kinds of graphs by the Grover walk. The first one consists of a cycle and two semi-infinite lines and the second one is assembled by a periodic embedding of the cycles in $\mathbb{Z}$. We show that both of them have essentially the same eigenvalues induced by the existence of cycles in the infinite graphs. The eigenspace of the homological structure appears as so called {\it localization} in the Grover walks, in that the walk is partially trapped by the homological structure. On the other hand, the difference of the absolutely continuous part of spectrum between them provides different behaviors. We characterize the behaviors by the density functions in the weak convergence theorem: the first one is the delta measure at the bottom while the second one is expressed by two kinds of continuous functions which have different finite supports $(-1/\sqrt{10},1/\sqrt{10})$ and $(-2/7,2/7)$, respectively.

<p><strong>10.    Relaxation dynamics of the toric code in contact with a thermal reservoir: Finite-size scaling in a low temperature regime</strong><br>
C. Daniel Freeman, C. M. Herdman, Dylan J Gorman, K. B. Whaley<br>
Phys. Rev. B 90, 134302 (2014)<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.2315">http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.2315</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We present an analysis of the relaxation dynamics of finite-size topological qubits in contact with a thermal bath. Using a continuous-time Monte Carlo method, we explicitly compute the low-temperature nonequilibrium dynamics of the toric code on finite lattices. In contrast to the size-independent bound predicted for the toric code in the thermodynamic limit, we identify a low-temperature regime on finite lattices below a size-dependent crossover temperature with nontrivial finite-size and temperature scaling of the relaxation time. We demonstrate how this nontrivial finite-size scaling is governed by the scaling of topologically nontrivial two-dimensional classical random walks. The transition out of this low-temperature regime defines a dynamical finite-size crossover temperature that scales inversely with the log of the system size, in agreement with a crossover temperature defined from equilibrium properties. We find that both the finite-size and finite-temperature scaling are stronger in the low-temperature regime than above the crossover temperature. Since this finite-temperature scaling competes with the scaling of the robustness to unitary perturbations, this analysis may elucidate the scaling of memory lifetimes of possible physical realizations of topological qubits.

<p><strong>11.    Phase Random Walk Trace in High-order Coherence of Two First-order Incoherent Sources</strong><br>
Peilong Hong, Guoquan Zhang<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.2381">http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.2381</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
High-order coherence effects between two first-order incoherent sources with fully independent phases have been well studied in the literature, which shows interference fringes with respect to the position separations among different space points. Here we show that this is not the whole story, and find that the high-order coherence effects depend on the mode of the phase random walk of the first-order incoherent sources, which can be controlled artificially and represented geometrically by vectorial polygons. Interestingly, by scanning the detectors along the same direction with the position separations between them kept constant, a set of high-order coherence fringes, which fingerprint the phase random walk of the first-order incoherent sources, can be observed. Our results show that it is possible to control the high-order coherence of two first-order incoherent sources, which could have important practical applications such as superhigh resolution optical lithography.
