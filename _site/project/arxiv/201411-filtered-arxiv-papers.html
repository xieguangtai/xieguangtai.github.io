    <p><strong>1.    Quantized recurrence time in iterated open quantum dynamics</strong><br>
P. Sinkovicz, Z. Kurucz, T. Kiss, J. K. Asb��th<br>
Phys. Rev. A 91, 042108 (2015)<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.0568">http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.0568</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
The expected return time to the original state is a key concept characterizing systems obeying both classical or quantum dynamics. We consider iterated open quantum dynamical systems in finite dimensional Hilbert spaces, a broad class of systems that includes classical Markov chains and unitary discrete time quantum walks on networks. Starting from a pure state, the time evolution is induced by repeated applications of a general quantum channel, in each timestep followed by a measurement to detect whether the system has returned to the original state. We prove that if the superoperator is unital in the relevant Hilbert space (the part of the Hilbert space explored by the system), then the expectation value of the return time is an integer, equal to the dimension of this relevant Hilbert space. We illustrate our results on partially coherent quantum walks on finite graphs. Our work connects the previously known quantization of the expected return time for bistochastic Markov chains and for unitary quantum walks, and shows that these are special cases of a more general statement. The expected return time is thus a quantitative measure of the size of the part of the Hilbert space available to the system when the dynamics is started from a certain state.

<p><strong>2.    Forrelation: A Problem that Optimally Separates Quantum from Classical Computing</strong><br>
Scott Aaronson, Andris Ambainis<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.5729">http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.5729</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We achieve essentially the largest possible separation between quantum and classical query complexities. We do so using a property-testing problem called Forrelation, where one needs to decide whether one Boolean function is highly correlated with the Fourier transform of a second function. This problem can be solved using 1 quantum query, yet we show that any randomized algorithm needs ~sqrt(N)/log(N) queries (improving an ~N^{1/4} lower bound of Aaronson). Conversely, we show that this 1 versus ~sqrt(N) separation is optimal: indeed, any t-query quantum algorithm whatsoever can be simulated by an O(N^{1-1/2t})-query randomized algorithm. Thus, resolving an open question of Buhrman et al. from 2002, there is no partial Boolean function whose quantum query complexity is constant and whose randomized query complexity is linear. We conjecture that a natural generalization of Forrelation achieves the optimal t versus ~N^{1-1/2t} separation for all t. As a bonus, we show that this generalization is BQP-complete. This yields what&#39;s arguably the simplest BQP-complete problem yet known, and gives a second sense in which Forrelation &quot;captures the maximum power of quantum computation.&quot;

<p><strong>3.    Narrowband Biphotons with Polarization-Frequency Coupled Hyperentanglement</strong><br>
Chi Shu, Xianxin Guo, Peng Chen, M. M. T. Loy, Shengwang Du<br>
Phys. Rev. A 91, 043820 (2015)<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.6119">http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.6119</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We demonstrate the generation of narrowband biphotons with polarization-frequency coupled hy- perentanglement from spontaneous four-wave mixing in cold atoms. The coupling between polariza- tion and frequency is realized through a frequency shifter and linear optics. When the polarization- frequency degrees of freedom are decoupled, it is robust to create polarization and frequency Bell states, confirmed by the polarization quantum-state tomography and the two-photon temporal quan- tum beating. Making use of the polarization-frequency coupling to transfer polarization phase retard to the entangled frequency modes, we produce a frequency Bell state with tunable phase difference between its two bases.

<p><strong>4.    History Dependent Quantum Walk on the Cycle with an Unbalanced Coin</strong><br>
Walter O. Krawec<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.6298">http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.6298</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
Recently, a new model of quantum walk, utilizing recycled coins, was introduced; however little is yet known about its properties. In this paper, we study its behavior on the cycle graph. In particular, we will consider its time averaged distribution and how it is affected by the walk&#39;s &quot;memory parameter&quot; - a real parameter, between zero and eight, which affects the walk&#39;s coin flip operator. Despite an infinite number of different parameters, our analysis provides evidence that only a few produce non-uniform behavior. Our analysis also shows that the initial state, and cycle size modulo four all affect the behavior of this walk. We also prove an interesting relationship between the recycled coin model and a different memory-based quantum walk recently proposed.

<p><strong>5.    Correlated random walks caused by dynamical wavefunction collapse</strong><br>
Daniel Bedingham, Hendrik Ulbricht<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.6921">http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.6921</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
Wavefunction collapse models modify Schr\&quot;odinger&#39;s equation so that it describes the collapse of a superposition of macroscopically distinguishable states as a dynamical process. This provides a basis for the resolution of the quantum measurement problem. An additional generic consequence of the collapse mechanism is that it causes particles to exhibit a tiny random diffusive motion. Here it is shown that for the continuous spontaneous localization (CSL) model---one of the most well developed collapse models---the diffusions of two sufficiently nearby particles are positively correlated. An experimental test of this effect is proposed in which random displacements of pairs of free nanoparticles are measured after they have been simultaneously released from nearby traps. The experiment must be carried out at sufficiently low temperature and pressure in order for the collapse effects to dominate over the ambient environmental noise. It is argued that these constraints can be satisfied by current technologies for a large region of the viable parameter space of the CSL model. The effect disappears as the separation between particles exceeds the CSL length scale. The test therefore provides a means of bounding this length scale.

<p><strong>6.    Edge-state enhanced transport in a 2-dimensional quantum walk</strong><br>
Janos K. Asboth, Jonathan M. Edge<br>
Phys. Rev. A 91, 022324 (2015)<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.3958">http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.3958</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
Quantum walks on translation invariant regular graphs spread quadratically faster than their classical counterparts. The same coherence that gives them this quantum speedup inhibits, or even stops their spread in the presence of disorder. We ask how to create an efficient transport channel from a fixed source site (A) to fixed target site (B) in a disordered 2-dimensional discrete-time quantum walk by cutting some of the links. We show that the somewhat counterintuitive strategy of cutting links along a single line connecting A to B creates such a channel. The efficient transport along the cut is due to topologically protected chiral edge states, which exist even though the bulk Chern number in this system vanishes. We give a realization of the walk as a periodically driven lattice Hamiltonian, and identify the bulk topological invariant responsible for the edge states as the quasienergy winding of this Hamiltonian.

<p><strong>7.    Quantum Walks of Two Interacting Anyons in 1D Optical Lattices</strong><br>
Limin Wang, Li Wang, Yunbo Zhang<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.5600">http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.5600</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We investigate continuous-time quantum walks of two indistinguishable anyons in one-dimensional lattices with both on-site and nearest-neighbor interactions based on the fractional Jordan-Wigner transformation. It is shown that the two-body correlations in position space are symmetric about the initial sites of two quantum walkers in the Bose limit ($\chi=0$ ) and Fermi limit ( $\chi=1$), while in momentum space this happens only in the Bose limit. An interesting asymmetry arises in the correlation for most cases with the statistical parameter $\chi$ varying in between. It turns out that the origin of this asymmetry comes from the fractional statistics that anyons obey. On the other hand, the two-body correlations of hard-core anyons in position spaceshow uniform behaviors from anti-bunching to co-walking regardless of the statistical parameter. The momentum correlations in the case of strong interaction undergo a smooth process of two stripes smoothly merging into a single one, i.e. the evolution of fermions into hard-core bosons.
