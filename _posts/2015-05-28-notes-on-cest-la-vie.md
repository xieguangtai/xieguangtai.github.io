`C'est la vie`, a French phrase, translated as *That's life*. The pronunciation can be found in [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSPdtPQM9Xk&list=WL), which is roughly "ce la vie" in English pronunciation.

It's something that you say when something happens that you do not like but which you have to accept because you cannot change it. Here is one scene.

Alice: I've got so much work that I can't go away this weekend.    
Bob: Oh well, c'est la vie.
