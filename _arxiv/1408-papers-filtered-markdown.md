**1.    Two-step hyperentanglement purification with the quantum-state-joining method**  
Bao-Cang Ren, Fang-Fang Du, Fu-Guo Deng  
Phys. Rev. A 90, 052309 (2014)

<blockquote>
<p>
Hyperentanglement is a promising resource in quantum information processing, especially for increasing the channel capacity of long-distance quantum communication. Hyperentanglement purification is an important method to obtain high-fidelity nonlocal hyperentangled states from mixed hyperentangled states in a long-distance quantum communication process with noisy channels. Here, we present a two-step hyperentanglement purification protocol for nonlocal mixed hyperentangled states with polarization bit-flip errors and spatial-mode phase-flip errors, resorting to polarization-spatial phase-check quantum nondemolition detectors and the quantum-state-joining method (QSJM). With QSJM, the protocol can preserve the states that are discarded in the previous hyperentanglement purification protocols. It has the advantage of a high efficiency, and it is useful for improving the entanglement of photon systems with several degrees of freedom in long-distance high-capacity quantum communication.

**2.    Efficiencies of Quantum Optical Detectors**  
Daniel Hogg, Dominic W. Berry, A. I. Lvovsky  
Physical Review A, 90(5), 053846 (2014)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1408.0257  
<blockquote>
<p>
We propose a definition for the efficiency that can be universally applied to all classes of quantum optical detectors. This definition is based on the maximum amount of optical loss that a physically plausible device can experience while still replicating the properties of a given detector. We prove that detector efficiency cannot be increased using linear optical processing. That is, given a set of detectors, as well as arbitrary linear optical elements and ancillary light sources, it is impossible to construct detection devices that would exhibit higher efficiencies than the initial set.

**3.    Quantum noise effects with Kerr nonlinearity enhancement in coupled gain-loss waveguides**  
Bing He, Shu-Bin Yan, Jing Wang, Min Xiao  
Phys. Rev. A 91, 053832 (2015)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1408.0565  
<blockquote>
<p>
It is generally difficult to study the dynamical properties of a quantum system with both inherent quantum noises and non-perturbative nonlinearity. Due to the possibly drastic intensity increase of an input coherent light in the gain-loss waveguide couplers with parity-time (PT) symmetry, the Kerr effect from a nonlinearity added into the systems can be greatly enhanced, and is expected to create the macroscopic entangled states of the output light fields with huge photon numbers. Meanwhile, the quantum noises also coexist with the amplification and dissipation of the light fields. Under the interplay between the quantum noises and nonlinearity, the quantum dynamical behaviors of the systems become rather complicated. However, the important quantum noise effects have been mostly neglected in the previous studies about nonlinear PT-symmetric systems. Here we present a solution to this non-perturbative quantum nonlinear problem, showing the real-time evolution of the system observables. The enhanced Kerr nonlinearity is found to give rise to a previously unknown decoherence effect that is irrelevant to the quantum noises, and imposes a limit on the emergence of macroscopic nonclassicality. In contrast to what happen in the linear systems, the quantum noises exert significant impact on the system dynamics, and can create the nonclassical light field states in conjunction with the enhanced Kerr nonlinearity. This first study on the noise involved quantum nonlinear dynamics of the coupled gain-loss waveguides can help to better understand the quantum noise effects in the broad nonlinear systems.

**5.    Passive correction of quantum logical errors in a driven, dissipative system: a blueprint for an analog quantum code fabric**  
Eliot Kapit, John T. Chalker, Steven H. Simon  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1408.0959  
<blockquote>
<p>
A physical realization of self correcting quantum code would be profoundly useful for constructing a quantum computer. In this theoretical work, we provide a partial solution to major challenges preventing self correcting quantum code from being engineered in realistic devices. We consider a variant of Kitaev's toric code coupled to propagating bosons, which induce a long-ranged interaction between anyonic defects. By coupling the primary quantum system to an engineered dissipation source through resonant energy transfer, we demonstrate a "rate barrier" which leads to a potentially enormous increase in the system's quantum state lifetime through purely passive quantum error correction, even when coupled to an infinite temperature bath. While our mechanism is not scalable to infinitely large systems, the maximum effective size can be very large, and it is fully compatible with active error correction schemes. Our model uses only on-site and nearest-neighbor interactions, and could be implemented in superconducting qubits. We sketch one such implementation at the end of this work.

**6.    Fault-Tolerant Quantum Walks**  
S. D. Freedman, Y. H. Tong, J. B. Wang  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1408.1250  
<blockquote>
<p>
Quantum walks are expected to serve important modelling and algorithmic applications in many areas of science and mathematics. Although quantum walks have been successfully implemented physically in recent times, no major efforts have been made to combat the error associated with these physical implementations in a fault-tolerant manner. In this paper, we propose a systematic method to implement fault-tolerant quantum walks in discrete time on arbitrarily complex graphs, using quantum states encoded with the Steane code and a set of universal fault tolerant matrix operations.

**7.    General Non-Markovian structure of Gaussian Master and Stochastic Schr?dinger Equations**

Phys.Rev.Lett. 113 (2014) 200403-(5)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1408.1273  
<blockquote>
<p>
General open quantum systems display memory features, their master equations are non-Markovian. We show that the subclass of Gaussian non-Markovian open system dynamics is tractable in a depth similar to the Markovian class. The structure of master equations exhibits a transparent generalization of the Lindblad structure. We find and parametrize the class of stochastic Schr\"odinger equations that unravel a given master equation, such class was before known for Markovian systems only. We show that particular non-Markovian unravellings known in the literature are special cases of our class.

**8.    Exact non-Markovian master equations for multiple qubit systems: quantum trajectory approach**  
Yusui Chen, J. Q. You, Ting Yu  
Phys. Rev. A 90, 052104 (2014)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1408.1475  
<blockquote>
<p>
A wide class of exact master equations for a multiple qubit system can be explicitly constructed by using the corresponding exact non-Markovian quantum state diffusion equations. These exact master equations arise naturally from the quantum decoherence dynamics of qubit system as a quantum memory coupled to a collective colored noisy source. The exact master equations are also important in optimal quantum control, quantum dissipation and quantum thermodynamics. In this paper, we show that the exact non-Markovian master equation for a dissipative N-qubit system can be derived explicitly from the statistical average of the corresponding non-Markovian quantum trajectories. We illustrated our general formulation by an explicit construction of a three-qubit system coupled to a non-Markovian bosonic environment. This multiple qubit master equation offers an accurate time evolution of quantum systems in various domains, and paves a way to investigate the memory effect of an open system in a non-Markovian regime without any approximation.

**9.    Control of single-photon transport in a one-dimensional waveguide by another single photon**  
Wei-Bin Yan, Heng Fan  
Phys. Rev. A 90, 053807 (2014)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1408.1502  
<blockquote>
<p>
We study the controllable single-photon transport in a one-dimensional (1D) waveguide with nonlinear dispersion relation coupled to a three-level emitter in cascade configuration. An extra cavity field was introduced to drive one of the level transitions of the emitter. In the resonance case, when the extra cavity does not contain photons, the input single photon will be reflected, and when the cavity contains one photon, the full transmission of the input single photon can be obtained. In the off-resonance case, the single-photon transport can also be controlled by the parameters of the cavity. Therefore, we have shown that the single-photon transport can be controlled by an extra cavity field.

**10.    Complexity analysis of quantum walk based search algorithms**  
B. L. Douglas, J. B. Wang  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1408.1616  
<blockquote>
<p>
We present several families of graphs that allow both efficient quantum walk implementations and efficient quantum walk based search algorithms. For these graphs, we construct quantum circuits that explicitly implement the full quantum walk search algorithm, without reference to a `black box' oracle. These circuits provide a practically implementable method to explore quantum walk based search algorithms with the aim of eventual real-world applications. We also provide a numerical analysis of a quantum walk based search along a twisted toroid family of graphs, which requires O($\sqrt{n}$ log($n$)) elementary 2-qubit quantum gate operations to find a marked node.

We analyze the non-Markovianity degree for random unitary evolution of d-level quantum systems. It is shown how non-Markovianity degree is characterized in terms of local decoherence rates. In particular we derive a su?cient condition for vanishing of the back ow of information.

**12.    Uhrig Dynamical Control of a Three-Level System Via Non-Markovian Quantum State Diffusion**  
Wenchong Shu, Xinyu Zhao, Jun Jing, Lian-Ao Wu, Ting Yu  
J. Phys. B: At. Mol. Opt. Phys. 46, 175504 (2013)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1408.2162  
<blockquote>
<p>
In this paper, we use the quantum state diffusion (QSD) equation to implement the Uhrig dynamical decoupling (UDD) to a three-level quantum system coupled to a non-Markovian reservoir comprising of infinite numbers of degrees of freedom. For this purpose, we first reformulate the non-Markovian QSD to incorporate the effect of the external control fields. With this stochastic QSD approach, we demonstrate that an unknown state of the three-level quantum system can be universally protected against both colored phase and amplitude noises when the control-pulse sequences and control operators are properly designed. The advantage of using non-Markovian quantum state diffusion equations is that the control dynamics of open quantum systems can be treated exactly without using Trotter product formula and be efficiently simulated even when the environment comprise of infinite numbers of degrees of freedom. We also show how the control efficacy depends on the environment memory time and the designed time points of applied control pulses.

**13.    Transmission of Photonic Quantum Polarization Entanglement in a Nanoscale Hybrid Plasmonic Waveguide**  
Ming Li, Chang-Ling Zou, Xi-Feng Ren, Xiao Xiong, Yong-Jing Cai, Guo-Ping Guo, Li-Min Tong, Guang-Can Guo  
Nano Lett. 15, 2380-2384 (2015)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1408.2409  
<blockquote>
<p>
Photonic quantum technologies have been extensively studied in quantum information science, owing to the high-speed transmission and outstanding low-noise properties of photons. However, applications based on photonic entanglement are restricted due to the diffraction limit. In this work, we demonstrate for the first time the maintaining of quantum polarization entanglement in a nanoscale hybrid plasmonic waveguide composed of a fiber taper and a silver nanowire. The transmitted state throughout the waveguide has a fidelity of 0.932 with the maximally polarization entangled state {\Phi}+. Furthermore, the Clauser, Horne, Shimony, and Holt (CHSH) inequality test performed, resulting in value of 2.495+/-0.147 > 2, demonstrates the violation of the hidden variable model. Because the plasmonic waveguide confines the effective mode area to subwavelength scale, it can bridge nanophotonics and quantum optics and may be used as near-field quantum probe in a quantum near-field micro/nanoscope, which can realize high spatial resolution, ultrasensitive, fiber-integrated, and plasmon-enhanced detection.

**14.    Information Dimension of Dissipative Quantum Walks**  
P. Schijven, O. Muelken  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1408.3037  
<blockquote>
<p>
We study the temporal growth of the von Neumann entropy for dissipative quantum walks on networks. By using a phenomenological quantum master equation, the quantum stochastic walk (QSW), we are able to parametrically scan the crossover from purely coherent quantum walks to purely diffusive random walks. In the latter limit the entropy shows a logarithmic growth, which is proportional to the information dimension of the random walk on the network. Here we present results for the von Neumann entropy based on the reduced density operator of the QSW. It shows a similar logarithmic growth for a wide range of parameter values and networks. As a consequence, we propose the logarithmic growth rate of the von Neumann entropy to be a natural extension of the information dimension to dissipative quantum systems. We corroborate our results by comparing to numerically exact simulations.

**15.    Surprising Interactions of Markovian noise and Coherent Driving**  
Shai Machnes, Martin B. Plenio  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1408.3056  
<blockquote>
<p>
We derive the explicit commutation relations for the generators of quantum dynamical semigroup - Markovian superoperator evolution, allowing the extension of Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff-type relations to general Lindblad-type evolutions. This provides a novel tool for exploring the interaction of time-dependent coherent and Markovian evolutions - a surprisingly rich set of behaviors which include deformation by coherent driving of Markovian terms, generation of new Lindblad terms from time-dependent noise and even a coherent driving term generated by the interaction of time-separated Markovian noises. Finally, we consider the Lindblad superoperators as vectors in a higher space, allowing us to extract the infinitely divisible subspace of a given channel and to recover its Lindblad form.

**16.    Dynamical properties of an exactly solvable coupled quantum double-well system: The evolution speed and entanglement**  
Hideo Hasegawa  
Physica E 66 (2015) 321  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1408.3088  
<blockquote>
<p>
We have studied dynamical properties of an exactly solvable quantum coupled double-well (DW) systems with Razavy's hyperbolic potential. With the use of four kinds of initial wavepackets, the correlation function $\Gamma(t)$ and the concurrence $C(t)$ which is a typical measure of the entanglement in two qubits, are calculated. We obtain the orthogonality time $\tau$ which signifies a time interval for an initial state to evolve to its orthogonal state, and the temporal average of $C(t)$, $C_{av}$ $(=\sqrt{\langle C(t)^2 \rangle})$. The coupling dependence of $\tau$ and the concurrence [$C_{av}$ or $C(0)$], and the relation between $\tau$ and the concurrence are investigated. Our calculations have shown that the evolution speed measured by $\tau^{-1}$ is not necessarily increased with increasing the concurrence in coupled DW systems.

**17.    Quantum lower bound for inverting a permutation with advice**  
Aran Nayebi, Scott Aaronson, Aleksandrs Belovs, Luca Trevisan  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1408.3193  
<blockquote>
<p>
Given a random permutation $f: [N] \to [N]$ as a black box and $y \in [N]$, we want to output $x = f^{-1}(y)$. Supplementary to our input, we are given classical advice in the form of a pre-computed data structure; this advice can depend on the permutation but \emph{not} on the input $y$. Classically, there is a data structure of size $\tilde{O}(S)$ and an algorithm that with the help of the data structure, given $f(x)$, can invert $f$ in time $\tilde{O}(T)$, for every choice of parameters $S$, $T$, such that $S\cdot T \ge N$. We prove a quantum lower bound of $T^2\cdot S \ge \tilde{\Omega}(\epsilon N)$ for quantum algorithms that invert a random permutation $f$ on an $\epsilon$ fraction of inputs, where $T$ is the number of queries to $f$ and $S$ is the amount of advice. This answers an open question of De et al. We also give a $\Omega(\sqrt{N/m})$ quantum lower bound for the simpler but related Yao's box problem, which is the problem of recovering a bit $x_j$, given the ability to query an $N$-bit string $x$ at any index except the $j$-th, and also given $m$ bits of advice that depend on $x$ but not on $j$.

**18.    Quantum Spin Dimers from Chiral Dissipation in Cold-Atom Chains**  
Tomás Ramos, Hannes Pichler, Andrew J. Daley, Peter Zoller  
Phys. Rev. Lett. 113, 237203 (2014)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1408.4357  
<blockquote>
<p>
We consider the non-equilibrium dynamics of a driven dissipative spin chain with chiral coupling to a 1D bosonic bath, and its atomic implementation with a two-species mixture of cold quantum gases. The reservoir is represented by a spin-orbit coupled 1D quasi-condensate of atoms in a magnetized phase, while the spins are identified with motional states of a separate species of atoms in an optical lattice. The chirality of reservoir excitations allows the spins to couple differently to left and right moving modes, which in our atomic setup can be tuned from bidirectional to purely unidirectional. Remarkably, this leads to a pure steady state in which pairs of neighboring spins form dimers that decouple from the remainder of the chain. Our results also apply to current experiments with two-level emitters coupled to photonic waveguides.

**19.    Quantum annealing correction for random Ising problems**  
Kristen L. Pudenz, Tameem Albash, Daniel A. Lidar  
Phys. Rev. A 91, 042302 (2015)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1408.4382  
<blockquote>
<p>
We demonstrate that the performance of a quantum annealer on hard random Ising optimization problems can be substantially improved using quantum annealing correction (QAC). Our error correction strategy is tailored to the D-Wave Two device. We find that QAC provides a statistically significant enhancement in the performance of the device over a classical repetition code, improving as a function of problem size as well as hardness. Moreover, QAC provides a mechanism for overcoming the precision limit of the device, in addition to correcting calibration errors. Performance is robust even to missing qubits. We present evidence for a constructive role played by quantum effects in our experiments by contrasting the experimental results with the predictions of a classical model of the device. Our work demonstrates the importance of error correction in appropriately determining the performance of quantum annealers.

We propose a QKD protocol for trusted node relays.

**21.    Lowest-order relativistic corrections to the fundamental limits of nonlinear-optical coefficients**  
Nathan J. Dawson  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1408.4843  
<blockquote>
<p>
The effects of small relativistic corrections to the off-resonant polarizability, hyperpolarizability, and second hyperpolarizability are investigated. Corrections to linear and nonlinear optical coefficients are demonstrated in the three-level ansatz, which includes corrections to the Kuzyk limits when scaled to semi-relativistic energies. It is also shown that the maximum value of the hyperpolarizability is more sensitive than the maximum polarizability or second hyperpolarizability to lowest-order relativistic corrections. These corrections illustrate how the intrinsic nonlinear-optical response is affected at semi-relativistic energies.

**22.    Teleportation-Based Continuous Variable Quantum Cryptography**  
F. S. Luiz, Gustavo Rigolin  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1408.5012  
<blockquote>
<p>
We show a continuous variable (CV) quantum key distribution (QKD) scheme based on the CV quantum teleportation of coherent states that yields a raw secret key made up of discrete variables for both Alice and Bob. This protocol preserves the efficient detection schemes of current CV technology (no single-photon detection techniques) and, at the same time, has efficient error correction and privacy amplification schemes due to its binary discrete key. In particular, it is secure for any value of the transmission efficiency of the optical line used by Alice to share entangled two-mode squeezed states with Bob (no 3 dB or 50% loss limitation characteristic of beam splitting attacks). The present CVQKD protocol works deterministically (no postselection needed) with efficient direct reconciliation techniques (no reverse reconciliation) in order to generate a secure key, even at the surprisingly 100% loss case.

**23.    One-Dimensional Coinless Quantum Walks**  
Renato Portugal, Stefan Boettcher, Stefan Falkner  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1408.5166  
<blockquote>
<p>
A coinless, discrete-time quantum walk possesses a Hilbert space whose dimension is smaller compared to the widely-studied coined walk. Coined walks require the direct product of the site basis with the coin space, coinless walks operate purely in the site basis, which is clearly minimal. These coinless quantum walks have received considerable attention recently because they have evolution operators that can be obtained by a graphical method based on lattice tessellations and they have been shown to be as efficient as the best known coined walks when used as a quantum search algorithm. We argue that both formulations in their most general form are equivalent. In particular, we demonstrate how to transform the one-dimensional version of the coinless quantum walk into an equivalent extended coined version for a specific family of evolution operators. We present some of its basic, asymptotic features for the one-dimensional lattice with some examples of tessellations, and analyze the mixing time and limiting probability distributions on cycles.

Alejandro Romanelli, Raul Donangelo, Renato Portugal, Franklin L. Marquezino  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1408.5300  
<blockquote>
<p>
The entanglement between the position and coin state of a $N$-dimensional quantum walker is shown to lead to a thermodynamic theory. The entropy, in this thermodynamics, is associated to the reduced density operator for the evolution of chirality, taking a partial trace over positions. From the asymptotic reduced density matrix it is possible to define thermodynamic quantities, such as the asymptotic entanglement entropy, temperature, Helmholz free energy, etc. We study in detail the case of a $2$-dimensional quantum walk, in the case of two different initial conditions: a non-separable coin-position initial state, and a separable one. The resulting entanglement temperature is presented as function of the parameters of the system and those of the initial conditions.

<p>
Applying a multiphoton-subtraction technique to two-color macroscopic squeezed vacuum state of light generated via high-gain parametric down conversion we conditionally prepare a new state of light: bright multi-mode low-noise twin beams. The obtained results demonstrate up to 8-fold suppression of noise in each beam while preserving and even moderately improving the nonclassical photon number correlations between the beams. The prepared low-noise macroscopic state, containing up to 2000 photons per mode, is not among the states achievable through nonlinear optical processes. The proposed technique substantially improves the usefulness of twin beams for quantum technologies.

<p>
In this letter we introduce the concept of a driven quantum walk. This work is motivated by recent theoretical and experimental progress that combines quantum walks and parametric down- conversion, leading to fundamentally different phenomena. We compare these striking differences by relating the driven quantum walks to the original quantum walk. Next, we illustrate typical dynamics of such systems and show these walks can be controlled by various pump configurations and phase matchings. Finally, we end by proposing an application of this process based on a quantum search algorithm that performs faster than a classical search.

<p>
Discrete time quantum walks are known to be universal for quantum computation. This has been proven by showing that they can simulate a universal quantum gate set. In this paper, we examine computation by quantum walks in terms of language acceptance, and present two ways in which discrete time quantum walks can accept some languages with certainty. These walks can take quantum as well as classical inputs, and we show that when the input is quantum, the walks can also be interpreted as performing the task of quantum state discrimination.

A general scheme for identifying the conservation laws in such PT-symmetric photonic networks is also presented.

<p>
Landau levels and states of electrons in a magnetic field are fundamental quantum entities underlying the quantum-Hall and related effects in condensed matter physics. However, the real-space properties and observation of Landau wave functions remain elusive. Here we report the first real-space observation of Landau states and the internal rotational dynamics of free electrons. States with different quantum numbers are produced using nanometer-size electron vortex beams, with a radius chosen to match the waist of the Landau states, in a quasi-uniform magnetic field. Scanning the beams along the propagation direction, we reconstruct the rotational dynamics of the Landau wave functions with angular frequency ~100 GHz. We observe that Landau modes with different azimuthal quantum numbers belong to three classes, which are characterized by rotations with zero, Larmor, and cyclotron frequencies, respectively. This is in sharp contrast to the uniform cyclotron rotation of classical electrons, and in perfect agreement with recent theoretical predictions.

<p>
It has been proved that surface plasmon polariton (SPP) can well conserve and transmit the quantum nature of entangled photons. Therefore, further utilization and manipulation of such quantum nature of SPP in a plasmonic chip will be the next task for scientists in this field. In quantum logic circuits, the controlled-NOT (CNOT) gate is the key building block. Here, we implement the first plasmonic quantum CNOT gate with several-micrometer footprint by utilizing a single polarization-dependent beam-splitter (PDBS) fabricated on the dielectric-loaded SPP waveguide (DLSPPW). The quantum logic function of the CNOT gate is characterized by the truth table with an average fidelity of. Its entangling ability to transform a separable state into an entangled state is demonstrated with the visibilities of and for non-orthogonal bases. The DLSPPW based CNOT gate is considered to have good integratability and scalability, which will pave a new way for quantum information science.

<p>
We derive experimentally measurable lower bounds for the two-site entanglement of the spin-degrees of freedom of many-body systems with local particle-number fluctuations. Our method aims at enabling the spatially resolved detection of spin-entanglement in Hubbard systems using high-resolution imaging in optical lattices. A possible application is the observation of entanglement generation and spreading during spin impurity dynamics, for which we provide numerical simulations. More generally, the scheme can simplify the entanglement detection in ion chains, Rydberg atoms, or similar atomic systems.

<p>
Sinkhorn proved that every entry-wise positive matrix can be made doubly stochastic by multiplying with two diagonal matrices. In this note we prove a recently conjectured analogue for unitary matrices: every unitary can be decomposed into two diagonal unitaries and one whose row- and column sums are equal to one. The proof is non-constructive and based on a reformulation in terms of symplectic topology. As a corollary, we obtain a decomposition of unitary matrices into an interlaced product of unitary diagonal matrices and discrete Fourier transformations. This provides a new decomposition of linear optics arrays into phase shifters and canonical multiports described by Fourier transformations.

**35.    Nanowaveguides integrated with a mirror as a scalable platform for collective atom-light interaction**  
Y. Meng, J. Lee, M. Dagenais, S. L. Rolston

<blockquote>
<p>
We have demonstrated a silicon nitride nanowaveguide that has high fiber-to-waveguide coupling efficiencies for both near-infrared wavelengths of 760nm and 1064nm. A carefully designed inverse taper improves the coupling efficiency from around 1% to more than 60%, and is estimated by a propagation loss measurement with multiple waveguides of different lengths. Such dual-color waveguides may be used to confine laser-cooled atoms in the evanescent field, creating a potentially scalable nanophotonic platform for atomic sensor and quantum information applications.

**36.    Vacuum Lightcone Fluctuations in a Dielectric**

<blockquote>
<p>
A model for observable effects of electromagnetic vacuum fluctuations is presented. The model involves a probe pulse which traverses a slab of nonlinear optical material with a nonzero second order polarizability. We argue that the pulse interacts with the ambient vacuum fluctuations of other modes of the quantized electric field, and these vacuum fluctuations cause variations in the flight time of the pulse through the material. The geometry of the slab of material defines a sampling function for the quantized electric field, which in turn determines that vacuum modes whose wavelengths are of the order of the thickness of the slab give the dominant contribution. Some numerical estimates are made, which indicate that fractional fluctuations in flight time of the order of $10^{-9}$ are possible in realistic situations. The model presented here is both an illustration of a physical effect of vacuum fluctuations, and an analog model for the lightcone fluctuations predicted by quantum gravity.
