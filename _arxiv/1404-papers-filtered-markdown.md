**1.    Environmental correlations and Markovian to non-Markovian transitions in collisional models**  
N. K. Bernardes, A. R. R. Carvalho, C. H. Monken, M. F. Santos  
Physical Review A 90, 032111 (2014)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1404.0019  
<blockquote>
<p>
We investigate the smallest set of requirements for inducing non-Markovian dynamics in a collisional model of open quantum systems. This is done by introducing correlations in the state of the environment and analyzing the divisibility of the quantum maps from consecutive time steps. Our model and results serve as a platform for the microscopic study of non-Markovian behavior as well as an example of a simple scenario of non-Markovianity with purely contractive maps, i.e. with no back-flow of information between system and environment.

**2.    Effect of temperature on non-Markovian dynamics in Coulomb crystals**  
Massimo Borrelli, Sabrina Maniscalco  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1404.0149  
<blockquote>
<p>
In this paper we generalize the results reported in Phys. Rev. A 88, 010101 (2013) and investigate the flow of information induced in a Coulomb crystal in presence of thermal noise. For several temperatures we calculate the non-Markovian character of Ramsey interferometry of a single 1/2 spin with the motional degrees of freedom of the whole chain. These results give a more realistic picture of the interplay between temperature, non-Markovianity and criticality.

**3.    Quantum walks on graphs representing the firing patterns of a quantum neural network**  
Maria Schuld, Ilya Sinayskiy, Francesco Petruccione  
Phys. Rev. A 89 032333 (2014)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1404.0159  
<blockquote>
<p>
Quantum walks have been shown to be fruitful tools in analysing the dynamic properties of quantum systems. This article proposes to use quantum walks as an approach to Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs). QNNs replace binary McCulloch-Pitts neurons with a qubit in order to use the advantages of quantum computing in neural networks. A quantum walk on the firing states of such a QNN is supposed to simulate central properties of the dynamics of classical neural networks, such as associative memory. It is shown that a biased discrete Hadamard walk derived from the updating process of a biological neuron does not lead to a unitary walk. However, a Stochastic Quantum Walk between the global firing states of a QNN can be constructed and it is shown that it contains the feature of associative memory. The quantum contribution to the walk accounts for a modest speed-up in some regimes.

**4.    Achievability of two qubit gates using linear optical elements and post-selection**  
Josh Cadney  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1404.0181  
<blockquote>
<p>
We study the class of two qubit gates which can be achieved using only linear optical elements (beam splitters and phase shifters) and post-selection. We are able to exactly characterize this set, and find that it is impossible to implement most two qubit gates in this way. The proof also gives rise to an algorithm for calculating the optimal success probability of those gates which are achievable.

<blockquote>
<p>
Integrated quantum optics becomes a consequent tendency towards practical quantum information processing. Here, we report the on-chip generation and manipulation of photonic entanglement based on reconfigurable lithium niobate waveguide circuits. By introducing periodically poled structure into the waveguide interferometer, two individual photon-pair sources with controllable phase-shift are produced and cascaded by a quantum interference, resulting in a deterministically separated identical photon pair. The state is characterized by 92.9% visibility Hong-Ou-Mandel interference. Continuous morphing from two-photon separated state to bunched state is further demonstrated by on-chip control of electro-optic phase-shift. The photon flux reaches ~1.4*10^7 pairs nm-1 mW-1. Our work presents a scenario for on-chip engineering of different photon sources and paves a way to the fully integrated quantum technologies.

**6.    Quantum Circuit for Calculating Mean Values Via Grover-like Algorithm**  
Robert R. Tucci  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1404.0668  
<blockquote>
<p>
In this paper, we give a quantum circuit for calculating the mean value of a function $A(x^n)\in \mathbb{C}$, where $x^n\in \{0,1\}^n$. Known classical algorithms for calculating the mean value of a structureless function $A(x^n)$ take ${\cal O}(2^n)$ steps. Our quantum algorithm is based on a Grover-like algorithm and it takes ${\cal O}(\sqrt{2^n})$ steps. Our algorithm differs significantly from previously proposed quantum algorithms for calculating the mean value of a function via Grover's algorithm.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1404.0830  
<blockquote>
<p>
We study the single-photon transport in a single-mode waveguide, in which two-level atoms in spatial superpositions are embedded. We find that the transmission of the photon can be used as a non-destructive probe for coherence of the superposition. The protocol proposed is shown to be independent of the distance between the wells in which the atoms are trapped. Furthermore, we show that by looking at the transmission in a suitable regime, a maximally entangled state can be post-selected from an unknown superposition.

**8.    Turbulence as a Resource for Quantum Key Distribution in Long Distance Free-Space Links**  
Giuseppe Vallone, Davide Marangon, Matteo Canale, Ilaria Savorgnan, Davide Bacco, Mauro Barbieri, Simon Calimani, Cesare Barbieri, Nicola Laurenti, Paolo Villoresi  
Phys. Rev. A 91, 042320 (2015)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1404.1272  
<blockquote>
<p>
Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) allows to share random keys between two users with unconditional security: the key is usually generated by exchanging a stream of photons. The long-term vision of QKD is represented by a quantum network, implemented by fiber and free-space links involving ground and/or satellites stations. The presence of the atmospheric turbulence represents an obstacle for free-space quantum communications, due to the increase of optical losses. Here we introduce a method to exploit the atmospheric turbulence as a resource for QKD. An Adaptive Real Time Selection (ARTS) technique at the receiver allows to take advantage of the fluctuating transmissivity of the channel, giving rise to an increase of the secure key rate.

Phys. Rev. A 90, 012307, 2014  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1404.1330  
<blockquote>
<p>
We revisit the one dimensional discrete time quantum walk with 3 states and the Grover coin. We derive analytic expressions for observed the localization, an long time approximation for the probability density function (PDF). We also connect the time averaged approximation to the PDF found by Inui et. al. to a spatial average of the walk. We show that this smooth approximation constitutes a proper PDF that predicts moments of the real PDF accurately.

**11.    A limit theorem for a 3-period time-dependent quantum walk**  
F. Alberto Grünbaum, Takuya Machida  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1404.1509  
<blockquote>
<p>
We consider a discrete-time 2-state quantum walk on the line. The state of the quantum walker evolves according to a rule which is determined by a coin-flip operator and a position-shift operator. In this paper we take a 3-periodic time evolution as the rule. For such a quantum walk, we get a limit distribution which expresses the asymptotic behavior of the walker after a long time. The limit distribution is different from that of a time-independent quantum walk or a 2-period time-dependent quantum walk. We give some analytical results and then consider a number of variants of our model and indicate the result of simulations for these ones.

**12.    Limit theorems of a 3-state quantum walk and its application for discrete uniform measures**  
Takuya Machida  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1404.1522  
<blockquote>
<p>
We present two long-time limit theorems of a 3-state quantum walk on the line when the walker starts from the origin. One is a limit measure which is obtained from the probability distribution of the walk at a long-time limit, and the other is a convergence in distribution for the walker's position in a rescaled space by time. In addition, as an application of the walk, we obtain discrete uniform limit measures from the 3-state walk with a delocalized initial state.

**13.    A one-dimensional quantum walk with multiple-rotation on the coin**  
Peng Xue, Rong Zhang, Hao Qin, Xiang Zhan, Zhihao Bian, Jian Li  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1404.1611  
<blockquote>
<p>
We introduce and analyze a one-dimensional quantum walk with two time-independent rotations on the coin. We study the influence on the property of quantum walk due to the second rotation on the coin. Based on the asymptotic solution in the long time limit, a ballistic behaviour of this walk is observed. This quantum walk retains the quadratic growth of the variance if the combined operator of the coin rotations is unitary. That confirms no localization exhibits in this walk. This result can be extended to the walk with multiple time-independent rotations on the coin.

**14.    Macroscopically deterministic, Markovian thermalization in finite quantum spin systems**  
Hendrik Niemeyer, Kristel Michielsen, Hans de Raedt, Jochen Gemmer  
Phys. Rev. E 89, 012131, 2014  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1404.1805  
<blockquote>
<p>
A key feature of non-equilibrium thermodynamics is the Markovian, deterministic relaxation of coarse observables such as, for example, the temperature difference between two macroscopic objects which evolves independently of almost all details of the initial state. We demonstrate that the unitary dynamics for moderately sized spin-1/2 systems may yield the same type of relaxation dynamics for a given magnetization difference. This observation might contribute to the understanding of the emergence of thermodynamics within closed quantum systems.

Frederico Brito, Thiago Werlang  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1404.2502  
<blockquote>
<p>
We study the Markovianity of a composite system and its subsystems. We show how the dissipative nature of a subsystem dynamics can be modified without having to change properties of the composite system environment. By means of manipulating the system initial state or the subsystem couplings, we find that it is possible to induce a transition from Markov to non-Markov behavior, and vice versa, and have different behaviors for subsystem and composite system at the same time.

Phys. Rev. A 89, 042328 (2014)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1404.2749  
<blockquote>
<p>
We study the possibility of using guided photons to generate, control, and measure the entanglement of two qubits that is mediated by a one-dimensional waveguide. We show how entanglement can be generated both with single photon and with two-photon wavepackets. The introduction of a second photon allows for a manipulation of the entanglement between the qubits, and phenomena such as sudden death and revival of entanglement appear. Finally, we propose a procedure for entanglement detection via the scattering output of a single-photon over a qubit state.

**17.    Single-Photon Transistor Using a F?rster Resonance**  
Daniel Tiarks, Simon Baur, Katharina Schneider, Stephan Dürr, Gerhard Rempe  
Phys. Rev. Lett. 113, 053602 (2014)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1404.3061  
<blockquote>
<p>
An all-optical transistor is a device in which a gate light pulse switches the transmission of a target light pulse with a gain above unity. The gain quantifies the change of the transmitted target photon number per incoming gate photon. We study the quantum limit of one incoming gate photon and observe a gain of 20. The gate pulse is stored as a Rydberg excitation in an ultracold gas. The transmission of the subsequent target pulse is suppressed by Rydberg blockade which is enhanced by a F\"orster resonance. The detected target photons reveal in a single shot with a fidelity above 0.86 whether a Rydberg excitation was created during the gate pulse. The gain offers the possibility to distribute the transistor output to the inputs of many transistors, thus making complex computational tasks possible.

**18.    Genuinely multipartite entangled states and orthogonal arrays**  
Dardo Goyeneche, Karol Zyczkowski  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1404.3586  
<blockquote>
<p>
A pure quantum state of N subsystems with d levels each is called k-multipartite maximally entangled state, written k-uniform, if all its reductions to k qudits are maximally mixed. These states form a natural generalization of N-qudits GHZ states which belong to the class 1-uniform states. We establish a link between the combinatorial notion of orthogonal arrays and k-uniform states and prove the existence of several new classes of such states for N-qudit systems. In particular, known Hadamard matrices allow us to explicitly construct 2-uniform states for an arbitrary number of N>5 qubits. We show that finding a different class of 2-uniform states would imply the Hadamard conjecture, so the full classification of 2-uniform states seems to be currently out of reach. Additionally, single vectors of another class of 2-uniform states are one-to-one related to maximal sets of mutually unbiased bases. Furthermore, we establish links between existence of k-uniform states, classical and quantum error correction codes and provide a novel graph representation for such states.

**19.    Optimal Quench for Distance-Independent Entanglement and Maximal Block Entropy**  
Bedoor Alkurtass, Leonardo Banchi, Sougato Bose  
Phys. Rev. A 90, 042304 (2014)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1404.3634  
<blockquote>
<p>
We optimize a quantum walk of multiple fermions following a quench in a spin chain to generate near ideal resources for quantum networking. We first prove an useful theorem mapping the correlations evolved from specific quenches to the apparently unrelated problem of quantum state transfer between distinct spins. This mapping is then exploited to optimize the dynamics and produce large amounts of entanglement distributed in very special ways. Two applications are considered: the simultaneous generation of many Bell states between pairs of distant spins (maximal block entropy), or high entanglement between the ends of an arbitrarily long chain (distance-independent entanglement). Thanks to the generality of the result, we study its implementation in different experimental setups using present technology: NMR, ion traps and ultracold atoms in optical lattices.

**20.    Ideal negative measurements in quantum walks disprove theories based on classical trajectories**

Phys. Rev. X 5, 011003 (2015)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1404.3912  
<blockquote>
<p>
We report on a stringent test of the non-classicality of the motion of a massive quantum particle, which propagates on a discrete lattice. Measuring temporal correlations of the position of single atoms performing a quantum walk, we observe a $6\sigma$ violation of the Leggett-Garg inequality. Our results rigorously excludes (i.e. falsifies) any explanation of quantum transport based on classical, well-defined trajectories. We use so-called ideal negative measurements -- an essential requisite for any genuine Leggett-Garg test -- to acquire information about the atom's position, yet avoiding any direct interaction with it. The interaction-free measurement is based on a novel atom transport system, which allows us to directly probe the absence rather than the presence of atoms at a chosen lattice site. Beyond the fundamental aspect of this test, we demonstrate the application of the Leggett-Garg correlation function as a witness of quantum superposition. We here employ the witness to discriminate different types of walks spanning from merely classical to wholly quantum dynamics.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1404.3994  
<blockquote>
<p>
Engineering quantum particle systems, such as quantum simulators and quantum cellular automata, relies on full coherent control of quantum paths at the single particle level. Here we present an atom interferometer operating with single trapped atoms, where single particle wave packets are controlled through spin-dependent potentials. The interferometer is constructed from a sequence of discrete operations based on a set of elementary building blocks, which permit composing arbitrary interferometer geometries in a digital manner. We use this modularity to devise a spacetime analogue of the well-known spin echo technique, yielding insight into decoherence mechanisms. We also demonstrate mesoscopic delocalization of single atoms with a "separation-to-localization" ratio exceeding 500; this suggests their utilization beyond quantum logic applications as nano-resolution quantum probes in precision measurements, being able to measure potential gradients with precision $5\times 10^{-4}$ in units of gravitational acceleration $g$.

Kelvin Wang, Xinyu Zhao, Ting Yu  
Phys. Rev. A 89, 042320 (2014)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1404.4110  
<blockquote>
<p>
In this paper, a new quantum state restoration scheme is proposed based on the environment-assisted error correction (EAEC) scheme. By introducing a weak measurement reversal (WMR) operation, we shall show how to recover an initial state of a quantum open system without invoking random unitary decompositions which are known to be absent in many important physical systems. We illustrate our new scheme and compare it with a scheme purely based on the WMR operation in the case of dissipative channel. In the proposed new scheme, the successful probability of recovering an unknown initial state can be significantly improved when the information obtained from an environment measurement is taken into account. Moreover, we show that the applicable range of our proposed scheme is wider than the EAEC scheme. Finally, the optimization of the successful probability for possible Kraus decompositions is discussed.

<blockquote>
<p>
We derive a new sharp bound as the quantum speed limit (QSL) for the minimal evolution time of quantum open systems in the non-Markovian strong-coupling regime with initial mixed states by considering the effects of both renormalized Hamiltonian and dissipator. We find that the minimal evolution time and its QSL can decrease steeply by adjusting the coupling strength of the dissipator, which thus provides potential improvements of efficiency in many quantum physics and quantum information areas.

<p>
Realizing robust quantum information transfer between long-lived qubit registers is a key challenge for quantum information science and technology. Here we demonstrate unconditional teleportation of arbitrary quantum states between diamond spin qubits separated by 3 meters. We prepare the teleporter through photon-mediated heralded entanglement between two distant electron spins and subsequently encode the source qubit in a single nuclear spin. By realizing a fully deterministic Bell-state measurement combined with real-time feed-forward we achieve teleportation in each attempt while obtaining an average state fidelity exceeding the classical limit. These results establish diamond spin qubits as a prime candidate for the realization of quantum networks for quantum communication and network-based quantum computing.

<blockquote>
<p>
The ground-state entanglement of a single particle of the N-harmonium system (i.e., a completely-integrable model of $N$ particles where both the confinement and the two-particle interaction are harmonic) is shown to be analytically determined in terms of $N$ and the relative interaction strength. For bosons, we compute the von Neumann entropy of the one-body reduced density matrix by using the corresponding natural occupation numbers. There exists a critical number $N_c$ of particles so that below it, for positive values of the coupling constant, the entanglement grows when the number of particles is increasing; the opposite occurs for $N > N_c$. For fermions, we compute the one-body reduced density matrix for the closed-shell spinned case. In the strong coupling regime, the linear entropy of the system decreases when $N$ is growing. For fixed $N$, the entanglement is found (a) to decrease (increase) for negatively (positively) increasing values of the coupling constant, and (b) to grow when the energy is increasing. Moreover, the spatial and spin contributions to the total entanglement are found to be of comparable size.

We formalize a notion of discrete Lorentz transforms for Quantum Walks (QW) and Quantum Cellular Automata (QCA), in (1 + 1)-dimensional discrete spacetime.

We then introduce the Clock QW and the Clock QCA, and prove that they are exactly discrete Lorentz covariant. The theory also allows for non-homogeneous Lorentz transforms, between non-inertial frames.

<p>
Randomly breaking connections in a graph alters its transport properties, a model used to describe percolation. In the case of quantum walks, dynamic percolation graphs represent a special type of imperfections, where the connections appear and disappear randomly in each step during the time evolution. The resulting open system dynamics is hard to treat numerically in general. We shortly review the literature on this problem. We then present our method to solve the evolution on finite percolation graphs in the long time limit, applying the asymptotic methods concerning random unitary maps. We work out the case of one dimensional chains in detail and provide a concrete, step by step numerical example in order to give more insight into the possible asymptotic behavior. The results about the case of the two-dimensional integer lattice are summarized, focusing on the Grover type coin operator.

<p>
We describe an approach to optical non-reciprocity that exploits the local helicity of evanescent electric fields in axisymmetric resonators. By interfacing an optical cavity to helicity-sensitive transitions, such as Zeeman levels in a quantum dot, light transmission through a waveguide becomes direction-dependent when the state degeneracy is lifted. Using a linearized quantum master equation, we analyze the configurations that exhibit non-reciprocity, and we show that reasonable parameters from existing cavity QED experiments are sufficient to demonstrate a coherent non-reciprocal optical isolator operating at the level of a single photon.

<blockquote>
<p>
Josephson junction parametric amplifiers are playing a crucial role in the readout chain in superconducting quantum information experiments. However, their integration with current 3D cavity implementations poses the problem of transitioning between waveguide, coax cables and planar circuits. Moreover, Josephson amplifiers require auxiliary microwave components, like directional couplers and/or hybrids, that are sources of spurious losses and impedance mismatches that limit measurement efficiency and amplifier tunability. We have developed a new wireless architecture for these parametric amplifiers that eliminates superfluous microwave components and interconnects. This greatly simplifies their assembly and integration into experiments. We present an experimental realization of such a device operating in the $9-11$ GHz band with about $100$ MHz of amplitude gain-bandwidth product, on par with devices mounted in conventional sample holders. The simpler impedance environment presented to the amplifier also results in increased amplifier tunability.

**32.    Optimal bounds for parity-oblivious random access codes**  
André Chailloux, Iordanis Kerenidis, Srijita Kundu, Jamie Sikora  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1404.5153  
<blockquote>
<p>
Random access coding is an information task that has been extensively studied and found many applications in quantum information. In this scenario, Alice receives an $n$-bit string $x$, and wishes to encode $x$ into a quantum state $\rho_x$, such that Bob, when receiving the state $\rho_x$, can choose any bit $i \in [n]$ and recover the input bit $x_i$ with high probability. Here we study a variant called parity-oblivious random access codes, where we impose the cryptographic property that Bob cannot infer any information about the parity of any subset of bits of the input, apart from the single bits $x_i$. We provide the optimal quantum parity-oblivious random access codes and show that they are asymptotically better than the optimal classical ones. For this, we relate such encodings to a non-local game and provide tight bounds for the success probability of the non-local game via semidefinite programming. We also extend the well-known quantum random access codes for encoding $2$ or $3$ classical bits into a single qubit. Our results provide a large non-contextuality inequality violation and resolve the main open problem in a work of Spekkens, Buzacott, Keehn, Toner, and Pryde (2009).

<blockquote>
<p>
Non-Markovian evolution of an open quantum system can be induced by the memory effects of a reservoir. Although a reservoir with stronger memory effects may seem like it should cause stronger non-Markovian effects on the system of interest, this seemingly intuitive thinking may not always be correct. We illustrate this by investigating a qubit (a two-level atom) that is coupled to a hierarchical environment, which contains a single-mode cavity and a reservoir consisting of infinite numbers of modes. We show how the non-Markovian character of the system is influenced by the coupling strength between the qubit and cavity and the correlation time of the reservoir. In particular, we found a new phenomenon whereby the qubit Markovian and non-Markovian transition exhibits a anomalous pattern in a parameter space depicted by the coupling strength and the correlation time of the reservoir.

<p>
Scalable quantum computing and communication requires the protection of quantum information from the detrimental effects of decoherence and noise. Previous work tackling this problem has relied on the original circuit model for quantum computing. However, recently a family of entangled resources known as graph states has emerged as a versatile alternative for protecting quantum information. Depending on the graph's structure, errors can be detected and corrected in an efficient way using measurement-based techniques. In this article we report an experimental demonstration of error correction using a graph state code. We have used an all-optical setup to encode quantum information into photons representing a four-qubit graph state. We are able to reliably detect errors and correct against qubit loss. The graph we have realized is setup independent, thus it could be employed in other physical settings. Our results show that graph state codes are a promising approach for achieving scalable quantum information processing.

<blockquote>
<p>
We study the properties of an array of QED-cavities coupled by nonlinear elements in the presence of photon leakage and driven by a coherent source. The main effect of the nonlinear couplings is to provide an effective cross-Kerr interaction between nearest-neighbor cavities. Additionally, correlated photon hopping between neighboring cavities arises. We provide a detailed mean-field analysis of the steady-state phase diagram as a function of the system parameters, the leakage, and the external driving, and show the emergence of a number of different quantum phases. A photon crystal associated to a spatial modulation of the photon blockade appears. The steady state can also display oscillating behavior and bistability. In some regions the crystalline ordering may coexist with the oscillating behavior. Furthermore we study the effect of short-range quantum fluctuations by employing a cluster mean-field analysis. Focusing on the corrections to the photon crystal boundaries, we show that, apart for some quantitative differences, the cluster mean field supports the findings of the simple single-site analysis. In the last part of the paper we concentrate on the possibility to build up the class of arrays introduced here, by means of superconducting circuits of existing technology. We consider a realistic choice of the parameters for this specific implementation and discuss some properties of the steady-state phase diagram.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1404.6433  
<blockquote>
<p>
We investigate the dynamics of information among the parties of tripartite systems. We start by proving two results concerning the monogamy of mutual information. The first one states that mutual information is monogamous for generic tripartite pure states. The second shows that in general mutual information is monogamous only if the amount of genuine tripartite correlations is large enough. Then, we analyze the internal dynamics of tripartite systems whose parties do not exchange energy. In particular, we allow for one of the subsystems to play the role of a finite thermal bath. As a result, we find a typical scenario in which local information tends to be converted into delocalized information. Moreover, we show that (i) the information flow is reversible for finite thermal baths at low temperatures, (ii) monogamy of mutual information is respected throughout the dynamics, and (iii) genuine tripartite correlations are typically present. Finally, we analytically calculate a quantity capable of revealing favorable regimes for non-Markovianity in our model.

**37.    Quantum Attacks on Classical Proof Systems - The Hardness of Quantum Rewinding**  
Andris Ambainis, Ansis Rosmanis, Dominique Unruh  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1404.6898  
<blockquote>
<p>
Quantum zero-knowledge proofs and quantum proofs of knowledge are inherently difficult to analyze because their security analysis uses rewinding. Certain cases of quantum rewinding are handled by the results by Watrous (SIAM J Comput, 2009) and Unruh (Eurocrypt 2012), yet in general the problem remains elusive. We show that this is not only due to a lack of proof techniques: relative to an oracle, we show that classically secure proofs and proofs of knowledge are insecure in the quantum setting. More specifically, sigma-protocols, the Fiat-Shamir construction, and Fischlin's proof system are quantum insecure under assumptions that are sufficient for classical security. Additionally, we show that for similar reasons, computationally binding commitments provide almost no security guarantees in a quantum setting. To show these results, we develop the "pick-one trick", a general technique that allows an adversary to find one value satisfying a given predicate, but not two.

<blockquote>
<p>
Quantum algorithms often assume independent spin qubits to produce trivial $|\uparrow\rangle=|0\rangle$, $|\downarrow\rangle=|1\rangle$ mappings. This can be unrealistic in many solid-state implementations with sizeable magnetic interactions. Here we show that the lower part of the spectrum of a molecule containing three exchange-coupled metal ions with $S=1/2$ and $I=1/2$ is equivalent to nine electron-nuclear qubits. We derive the relation between spin states and qubit states in reasonable parameter ranges for the rare earth $^{159}$Tb$^{3+}$ and for the transition metal Cu$^{2+}$, and study the possibility to implement Shor's Quantum Error Correction code on such a molecule. We also discuss recently developed molecular systems that could be adequate from an experimental point of view.

<blockquote>
<p>
We demonstrate a novel scheme for femto-second pulsed spontaneous parametric down-conversion in periodically poled KTP crystals. Our scheme is based on a crossed crystal configuration with collinear quasi-phase-matching. The non-degenerate photon pairs are split in a fiber-based wavelength division multiplexer. The source is easier to align than common pulsed sources based on bulk BBO crystals and exhibits high-quality polarization entanglement as well as non-classical interference capabilities. Hence, we expect this source to be a well-suited candidate for multi-photon state generation e.g. for linear optical quantum computation and quantum communication networks.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1404.7183  
<blockquote>
<p>
We analyze an entanglement-based quantum key distribution (QKD) architecture that uses a linear chain of quantum repeaters employing photon-pair sources, spectral-multiplexing, linear-optic Bell-state measurements, multi-mode quantum memories and classical-only error correction. Assuming perfect sources, we find an exact expression for the secret-key rate, and an analytical description of how errors propagate through the repeater chain, as a function of various loss and noise parameters of the devices. We show via an explicit analytical calculation, which separately addresses the effects of the principle non-idealities, that this scheme achieves a secret key rate that surpasses the TGW bound---a recently-found fundamental limit to the rate-vs.-loss scaling achievable by any QKD protocol over a direct optical link---thereby providing one of the first rigorous proofs of the efficacy of a repeater protocol. We extend our theoretical analysis to encompass sources with non-zero two-pair-emission probability, using an efficient exact numerical evaluation of the quantum state propagation and measurements. We expect our results to be useful for analyzing other non-QKD quantum protocols that require establishing long-distance entanglement, and to provide useful abstractions to seed analyses of quantum networks of more complex topologies.

**41.    Symmetric polynomials in information theory: entropy and subentropy**  
Richard Jozsa, Graeme Mitchison  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1404.7694  
<blockquote>
<p>
Entropy and other fundamental quantities of information theory are customarily expressed and manipulated as functions of probabilities. Here we study the entropy H and subentropy Q as functions of the elementary symmetric polynomials in the probabilities, and reveal a series of remarkable properties. Derivatives of all orders are shown to satisfy a complete monotonicity property. H and Q themselves become multivariate Bernstein functions and we derive the density functions of their Levy-Khintchine representations. We also show that H and Q are Pick functions in each symmetric polynomial variable separately. Furthermore we see that H and the intrinsically quantum informational quantity Q become surprisingly closely related in functional form, suggesting a special significance for the symmetric polynomials in quantum information theory. Using the symmetric polynomials we also derive a series of further properties of H and Q.

**42.    Probing spectral-temporal correlations with a versatile integrated source of parametric down-conversion states**

http://arxiv.org/abs/1404.7725  
<blockquote>
<p>
The spectral-temporal correlation and the correlation time of a biphoton wavepacket generated in the process of parametric down-conversion (PDC), is of great importance for a broad range of quantum experiments. We utilise an integrated PDC source to generate biphotons with different types of spectral-temporal correlations and probe their respective correlation times. The outcomes confirms that the correlation time is independent of the coherence time of the pump light, and it is only determined by the waveguide length and its dispersion properties. Furthermore, we investigate the properties of the PDC biphoton wavepacket exhibiting different types of spectral-temporal correlations and their suitability for quantum-enhanced applications.

J. Math. Phys. 55, (2014) 081704  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1404.1276  
<blockquote>
<p>
We present a generalization of Hirschman's entropic uncertainty principle for locally compact abelian groups to unimodular locally compact quantum groups. As a corollary, we strengthen a well-known uncertainty principle for compact groups, and generalize the relation to compact quantum groups of Kac type. We also establish the complementarity of finite-dimensional quantum group algebras. In the non-unimodular setting, we obtain an uncertainty relation for arbitrary locally compact groups using the relative entropy with respect to the Haar weight as the measure of uncertainty. We also show that when restricted to normal central states of discrete quantum groups, the relative entropy with respect to the Haar weight reduces to the canonical entropy of the random walk generated by the central state.

It has been proved that almost all $n$-bit Boolean functions have exact classical query complexity $n$. However, the situation seemed to be very different when we deal with exact quantum query complexity. In this paper, we prove that almost all $n$-bit Boolean functions can be computed by an exact quantum algorithm with less than $n$ queries. More exactly, we prove that ${AND}_n$ is the only $n$-bit Boolean function, up to isomorphism, that requires $n$ queries.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1404.3103  
<blockquote>
<p>
The excitonic occupancy state of a single, nanowire-based, heterostructure quantum dot is dynamically programmed by a surface acoustic wave. The quantum dot is formed by an interface or thickness fluctuation of a GaAs QW embedded in a AlGaAs shell of a GaAs-AlGaAs core-shell nanowire. As we tune the time at which carriers are photogenerated during the acoustic cycle, we find pronounced intensity oscillations of neutral and negatively charged excitons. At high acoustic power levels these oscillations become anticorrelated which enables direct acoustic programming of the dot's charge configuration, emission intensity and emission wavelength. Numerical simulations confirm that the observed modulations arise from acoustically controlled modulations of the electron and electron-hole-pair concentrations at the position of the quantum dot.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1404.6676  
<blockquote>
<p>
We present a multichannel quantum-defect theory for magnetic Feshbach resonances in the interaction of two heteronuclear group I atoms. The theory provides a unified and a uniform description of resonances in all partial waves, and enables the characterization of large number of resonances in terms of very few parameters. For the sample system of $^6$Li$^{40}$K, we present descriptions of all resonances in $aa$, $ab$, and $ba$ channels, in partial waves $s$ ($l=0$) through $h$ ($l=5$), and in a magnetic field of 0 through 1000 Gauss. All resonances, including those in nonzero partial waves, are fully characterized using the newly developed parametrization of Gao [Phy. Rev. A \textbf{84}, 022706 (2011)].
