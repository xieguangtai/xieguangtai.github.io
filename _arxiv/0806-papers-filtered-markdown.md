**1.    Nonlocal entanglement concentration scheme for partially entangled multipartite systems with nonlinear optics**  
Yu-Bo Sheng, Fu-Guo Deng, Hong-Yu Zhou  
Physical Review A 77, 062325 (2008)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0806.0115  
<blockquote>
<p>
We present a nonlocal entanglement concentration scheme for reconstructing some maximally entangled multipartite states from partially entangled ones by exploiting cross-Kerr nonlinearities to distinguish the parity of two polarization photons. Compared with the entanglement concentration schemes based on two-particle collective unitary evolution, this scheme does not require the parties to know accurately information about the partially entangled states--i.e., their coefficients. Moreover, it does not require the parties to possess sophisticated single-photon detectors, which makes this protocol feasible with present techniques. By iteration of entanglement concentration processes, this scheme has a higher efficiency and yield than those with linear optical elements. All these advantages make this scheme more efficient and more convenient than others in practical applications.

**2.    Superlinear Amplitude Amplification**  
Lov K. Grover  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0806.0154  
<blockquote>
<p>
Quantum search/amplitude amplification algorithms are designed to be able to amplify the amplitude in the target state linearly with the number of operations. Since the probability is the square of the amplitude, this results in the success probability rising quadratically with the number of operations. This paper presents a new kind of quantum search algorithm in which the amplitude of the target state, itself increases quadratically with the number of operations. However, the domain of applications of this is much more limited than standard amplitude amplification.

**3.    Perfect mirror transport protocol with higher dimensional quantum chains**  
Gerardo A. Paz-Silva, Stojan Rebic, Jason Twamley, Tim Duty  
Phys. Rev. Lett. 102, 020305 (2009)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0806.0194  
<blockquote>
<p>
A globally controlled scheme for quantum transport is proposed. The scheme works on a 1D chain of nearest neighbor coupled systems of qudits (finite dimension), or qunats (continuous variable), taking any arbitrary initial quantum state of the chain and producing a final quantum state which is perfectly spatially mirrored about the mid-point of the chain. As a particular novel application, the method can be used to transport continuous variable (CV) quantum states. A physical realization is proposed where it is shown how the quantum states of the microwave fields held in a chain of driven superconducting coplanar waveguides can experience quantum mirror transport when coupled by switchable Cooper Pair Boxes.

**4.    On Perfect Completeness for QMA**  
Scott Aaronson  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0806.0450  
<blockquote>
<p>
Whether the class QMA (Quantum Merlin Arthur) is equal to QMA1, or QMA with one-sided error, has been an open problem for years. This note helps to explain why the problem is difficult, by using ideas from real analysis to give a "quantum oracle" relative to which they are different. As a byproduct, we find that there are facts about quantum complexity classes that are classically relativizing but not quantumly relativizing, among them such "trivial" containments as BQP in ZQEXP.

**5.    Efficient Toffoli Gates Using Qudits**  
T.C.Ralph, K.J.Resch, A.Gilchrist  
Phys.Rev.A 75 022313 (2007)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0806.0654  
<blockquote>
<p>
The simplest decomposition of a Toffoli gate acting on three qubits requires {\em five} 2-qubit gates. If we restrict ourselves to controlled-sign (or controlled-NOT) gates this number climbs to six. We show that the number of controlled-sign gates required to implement a Toffoli gate can be reduced to just {\em three} if one of the three quantum systems has a third state that is accessible during the computation, i.e. is actually a qutrit. Such a requirement is not unreasonable or even atypical since we often artificially enforce a qubit structure on multilevel quantums systems (eg. atoms, photonic polarization and spatial modes). We explore the implementation of these techniques in optical quantum processing and show that linear optical circuits could operate with much higher probabilities of success.

http://arxiv.org/abs/0806.0875  
<blockquote>
<p>
We explain how to combine holonomic quantum computation (HQC) with fault tolerant quantum error correction. This establishes the scalability of HQC, putting it on equal footing with other models of computation, while retaining the inherent robustness the method derives from its geometric nature.

**7.    Overcoming non-Markovian dephasing in single photon sources through post-selection**  
Ahsan Nazir, Sean D. Barrett  
Phys. Rev. A 79, 011804(R) (2009)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0806.1164  
<blockquote>
<p>
We study the effects of realistic dephasing environments on a pair of solid-state single-photon sources in the context of the Hong-Ou-Mandel dip. By means of solutions for the Markovian or exact non-Markovian dephasing dynamics of the sources, we show that the resulting loss of visibility depends crucially on the timing of photon detection events. Our results demonstrate that the effective visibility can be improved via temporal post-selection, and also that time-resolved interference can be a useful probe of the interaction between the emitter and its host environment.

**8.    Non-Markovian band-edge effect and entanglement generation of quantum dot excitons coupled to nanowire surface plasmons**  
G. Y. Chen, Y. N. Chen, D. S. Chuu  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0806.1448  
<blockquote>
<p>
The radiative decay of quantum dot (QD) excitons into surface plasmons in a cylindrical nanowire is investigated theoretically. Maxwell's equations with appropriate boundary conditions are solved numerically to obtain the dispersion relations of surface plasmons. The radiative decay rate of QD excitons is found to be greatly enhanced at certain values of the exciton bandgap. Analogous to the decay of a two-level atom in the photonic crystal, we first point out that such an enhanced phenomenon allows one to examine the non-Markovian dynamics of the QD exciton. Besides, due to the one dimensional propagating feature of nanowire surface plasmons, remote entangled states can be generated via super-radiance and may be useful in future quantum information processing.

<p>
We propose an eavesdropping experiment with linear optical 1-3 phase-covariant quantum cloner. In this paper, we have designed an optical circuit of the cloner and shown how the eavesdropper (Eve) utilizes her clones. We have also optimized the measurement scheme for Eve by numerical calculation. The optimized measurement is easy to implement with liner optics.

**10.    Mathematical Foundation of Quantum Annealing**  
Satoshi Morita, Hidetoshi Nishimori  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0806.1859  
<blockquote>
<p>
Quantum annealing is a generic name of quantum algorithms to use quantum-mechanical fluctuations to search for the solution of optimization problem. It shares the basic idea with quantum adiabatic evolution studied actively in quantum computation. The present paper reviews the mathematical and theoretical foundation of quantum annealing. In particular, theorems are presented for convergence conditions of quantum annealing to the target optimal state after an infinite-time evolution following the Schroedinger or stochastic (Monte Carlo) dynamics. It is proved that the same asymptotic behavior of the control parameter guarantees convergence both for the Schroedinger dynamics and the stochastic dynamics in spite of the essential difference of these two types of dynamics. Also described are the prescriptions to reduce errors in the final approximate solution obtained after a long but finite dynamical evolution of quantum annealing. It is shown there that we can reduce errors significantly by an ingenious choice of annealing schedule (time dependence of the control parameter) without compromising computational complexity qualitatively. A review is given on the derivation of the convergence condition for classical simulated annealing from the view point of quantum adiabaticity using a classical-quantum mapping.

<p>
A single linear optical set-up is used to observe an entire family of four-photon entangled states. This approach breaks with the inflexibility of present linear-optical set-ups usually designed for the observation of a particular multi-partite entangled state only. The family includes several prominent entangled states that are known to be highly relevant for quantum information applications.

**13.    Universal computation by quantum walk**  
Andrew M. Childs  
Phys. Rev. Lett. 102, 180501 (2009)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0806.1972  
<blockquote>
<p>
In some of the earliest work on quantum mechanical computers, Feynman showed how to implement universal quantum computation by the dynamics of a time-independent Hamiltonian. I show that this remains possible even if the Hamiltonian is restricted to be a sparse matrix with all entries equal to 0 or 1, i.e., the adjacency matrix of a low-degree graph. Thus quantum walk can be regarded as a universal computational primitive, with any desired quantum computation encoded entirely in some underlying graph. The main idea of the construction is to implement quantum gates by scattering processes.

<p>
We study the possibility of preventing finite-time disentanglement caused by dissipation by making use of "non-local quantum error correction. This is made in comparison of previous results, where was shown that "local" quantum error correction can delay disentanglement, but can also cause entanglement sudden death when is not originally present.

**15.    The Stability of Quantum Concatenated Code Hamiltonians**  
D. Bacon  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0806.2160  
<blockquote>
<p>
Protecting quantum information from the detrimental effects of decoherence and lack of precise quantum control is a central challenge that must be overcome if a large robust quantum computer is to be constructed. The traditional approach to achieving this is via active quantum error correction using fault-tolerant techniques. An alternative to this approach is to engineer strongly interacting many-body quantum systems that enact the quantum error correction via the natural dynamics of these systems. Here we present a method for achieving this based on the concept of concatenated quantum error correcting codes. We define a class of Hamiltonians whose ground states are concatenated quantum codes and whose energy landscape naturally causes quantum error correction. We analyze these Hamiltonians for robustness and suggest methods for implementing these highly unnatural Hamiltonians.

**16.    Message passing in fault tolerant quantum error correction**  
Z. W. E. Evans, A. M. Stephens  
PRA 78, 062317 (2008)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0806.2188  
<blockquote>
<p>
Inspired by Knill's scheme for message passing error detection, here we develop a scheme for message passing error correction for the nine-qubit Bacon-Shor code. We show that for two levels of concatenated error correction, where classical information obtained at the first level is used to help interpret the syndrome at the second level, our scheme will correct all cases with four physical errors. This results in a reduction of the logical failure rate relative to conventional error correction by a factor proportional to the reciprocal of the physical error rate.

**17.    Schroedinger Cat: Entanglement test in a Micro-Macroscopic system**  
Francesco De Martini, Fabio Sciarrino, Chiara Vitelli  
Phys. Rev. Lett. 100, 253601 (2008)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0806.2218  
<blockquote>
<p>
A Macro-state consisting of N= 3.5 x 10^4 photons in a quantum superposition and entangled with a far apart single-photon state (Micro-state) is generated. Precisely, an entangled photon pair is created by a nonlinear optical process, then one photon of the pair is injected into an optical parametric amplifier (OPA) operating for any input polarization state, i.e. into a phase-covariant cloning machine. Such transformation establishes a connection between the single photon and the multi particle fields. We then demonstrate the non-separability of the bipartite system by adopting a local filtering technique within a positive operator valued measurement.

**18.    Matched Slow Pulses Using Double Electromagnetically Induced Transparency**  
Andrew MacRae, Geoff Campbell, A. I. Lvovsky  
Optics Letters 33, 2659 - 2661 (2008)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0806.2656  
<blockquote>
<p>
We implement double electromagnetically-induced transparency (double EIT) in rubidium vapor, using a tripod-shaped energy level scheme consisting of hyperfine and magnetic sublevels of the 5S1/2 to 5P1/2 transition. We show experimentally that through the use of double EIT one can control the contrast of transparency windows as well as group velocities of the two signal fields. In particular, the group velocities can be equalized, which holds promise to greatly enhance nonlinear optical interaction between these fields.

**19.    An overview of QML with a concrete implementation in Haskell**  
Jonathan Grattage  
ENTCS: Proceedings of QPL V - DCV IV, 157-165, Reykjavik, Iceland, 2008  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0806.2735  
<blockquote>
<p>
This paper gives an introduction to and overview of the functional quantum programming language QML. The syntax of this language is defined and explained, along with a new QML definition of the quantum teleport algorithm. The categorical operational semantics of QML is also briefly introduced, in the form of annotated quantum circuits. This definition leads to a denotational semantics, given in terms of superoperators. Finally, an implementation in Haskell of the semantics for QML is presented as a compiler. The compiler takes QML programs as input, which are parsed into a Haskell datatype. The output from the compiler is either a quantum circuit (operational), an isometry (pure denotational) or a superoperator (impure denotational). Orthogonality judgements and problems with coproducts in QML are also discussed.

Physical Review Letters 101, 233605 (2008)

<p>
We propose and demonstrate a novel method to generate a large-amplitude coherent-state superposition (CSS) via ancilla-assisted photon-subtraction. The ancillary mode induces quantum interference of indistinguishable processes, widening the controllability of quantum superposition at the conditional output. We demonstrate the concept in the time domain, by a simple time-separated two-photon subtraction from cw squeezed light. We observe the largest CSS ever reported without any corrections, which will enable various quantum information applications with CSS states.

<p>
Since the first derivation of non-Markovian stochastic Schr\"odinger equations, their interpretation has been contentious. In a recent Letter [Phys. Rev.

In this Letter we show that his proof is fundamentally flawed: the solution to his non-Markovian stochastic Schr\"odinger equation at any particular time can be interpreted as a conditioned state, but joining up these solutions as a trajectory creates a fiction.

Ognyan Oreshkov, Daniel A. Lidar, Todd A. Brun  
Phys. Rev. A 78, 022333 (2008)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0806.3145  
<blockquote>
<p>
We study the conditions under which a subsystem code is correctable in the presence of noise that results from continuous dynamics. We consider the case of Markovian dynamics as well as the general case of Hamiltonian dynamics of the system and the environment, and derive necessary and sufficient conditions on the Lindbladian and system-environment Hamiltonian, respectively. For the case when the encoded information is correctable during an entire time interval, the conditions we obtain can be thought of as generalizations of the previously derived conditions for decoherence-free subsystems to the case where the subsystem is time dependent. As a special case, we consider conditions for unitary correctability. In the case of Hamiltonian evolution, the conditions for unitary correctability concern only the effect of the Hamiltonian on the system, whereas the conditions for general correctability concern the entire system-environment Hamiltonian. We also derive conditions on the Hamiltonian which depend on the initial state of the environment, as well as conditions for correctability at only a particular moment of time. We discuss possible implications of our results for approximate quantum error correction.

**23.    Analysis of quantum semigroups with GKS--Lindblad generators II. General**  
Bernhard Baumgartner, Heide Narnhofer  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0806.3164  
<blockquote>
<p>
Semigroups describing the time evolution of open quantum systems in finite-dimensional spaces have generators of a special form, known as Lindblad generators. These generators and the corresponding processes of time evolution are analyzed, characterized as Decay, Dissipation and Dephasing. In relation to these processes the Hilbert space of the system is equipped with a special structure, a decomposition into a sum of mutually orthogonal subspaces. The complete set of all the stationary states and the asymptotic behavior of the evolutions are presented in detail. Some unusual special facts about invariant operators and symmetries are studied, examples are demonstrated. Perturbation theory for the structure and for the stationary states is discussed and performed in case studies.

**24.    Decoherence of two qubits in a non-Markovian reservoir without rotating-wave approximation**  
Fa-Qiang Wang, Zhi-Ming Zhang, Rui-Sheng Liang  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0806.3306  
<blockquote>
<p>
The decoherence of two initially entangled qubits in a non-Markovian reservoir has been investigated exactly without Born Markovian approximation and rotating-wave approximation(RWA). The non-perturbative quantum master equation is derived and its exact solution is obtained. The decoherence behaviors of two qubits, initially entangled in Bell states, has been investigated in three different cases of parameters. The results show that the counter-rotating wave terms have great influence on the decoherence behavior, and there are differences between the exact solution of the Hamiltonian with RWA and that of the exact Hamiltonian without RWA. It might be improper to take RWA when the atom is in a non-markovian reservoir.

**25.    Non-Markovian dynamics and von Neumann entropy evolution of a qubit in a spin environment**  
J. Rodríguez Garzón, R. M. Gutiérrez  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0806.3786  
<blockquote>
<p>
The dynamics of a central spin-1/2 in presence of a local magnetic field and a bath of N spin-1/2 particles is studied in the thermodynamic limit. The interaction between the spins is Heisenberg XY type and the bath is considered to be a perfect thermal reservoir. In this case, the evolution of the populations of the reduced density matrix are obtained for different temperatures. A Born approximation is made but not a Markov approximation resulting a non-Markovian dynamics. The measure of the way that the system mixes is obtained by means of the von Neumann entropy. For low temperatures, results show that there are oscillations of populations and of the von Neumann entropy, indicating that the central spin becomes a pure state with characteristic time periods in which it is possible to extract or recuperate information. In the regime of high temperatures, the evolution shows a final maximum mixed state with entropy S=ln 2 as it is expected for a two level system.

**27.    Investigations of a coherently driven semiconductor optical cavity QED system**  
Kartik Srinivasan, Christopher P. Michael, Raviv Perahia, Oskar Painter  
Physical Review A, Vol 78, 033839, 2008  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0806.4162  
<blockquote>
<p>
Chip-based cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED) devices consisting of a self-assembled InAs quantum dot (QD) coupled to a high quality factor GaAs microdisk cavity are coherently probed through their optical channel using a fiber taper waveguide. We highlight one particularly important aspect of this all-fiber measurement setup, which is the accuracy to which the optical coupling level and optical losses are known relative to typical free-space excitation techniques. This allows for precise knowledge of the intracavity photon number and measurement of absolute transmitted and reflected signals. Resonant optical spectroscopy of the system under both weak and strong driving conditions are presented, which when compared with a quantum master equation model of the system allows for determination of the coherent coupling rate between QD exciton and optical cavity mode, the different levels of elastic and inelastic dephasing of the exciton state, and the position and orientation of the QD within the cavity. Pump-probe measurements are also performed in which a far off-resonant red-detuned control laser beam is introduced into the cavity. Rather than producing a measurable ac-Stark shift in the exciton line of the QD, we find that this control beam induces a saturation of the resonant system response. The broad photoluminescence spectrum resulting from the presence of the control beam in the cavity points to sub-bandgap absorption in the semiconductor, and the resulting free-carrier generation, as the likely source of system saturation.

**28.    Quantum Coding with Entanglement**  
Mark M. Wilde  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0806.4214  
<blockquote>
<p>
Quantum error-correcting codes will be the ultimate enabler of a future quantum computing or quantum communication device. This theory forms the cornerstone of practical quantum information theory. We provide several contributions to the theory of quantum error correction--mainly to the theory of "entanglement-assisted" quantum error correction where the sender and receiver share entanglement in the form of entangled bits (ebits) before quantum communication begins. Our first contribution is an algorithm for encoding and decoding an entanglement-assisted quantum block code. We then give several formulas that determine the optimal number of ebits for an entanglement-assisted code. The major contribution of this thesis is the development of the theory of entanglement-assisted quantum convolutional coding. A convolutional code is one that has memory and acts on an incoming stream of qubits. We explicitly show how to encode and decode a stream of information qubits with the help of ancilla qubits and ebits. Our entanglement-assisted convolutional codes include those with a Calderbank-Shor-Steane structure and those with a more general structure. We then formulate convolutional protocols that correct errors in noisy entanglement. Our final contribution is a unification of the theory of quantum error correction--these unified convolutional codes exploit all of the known resources for quantum redundancy.

We propose a setup that transforms a photon pair in arbitrary rank-four mixed state, which could also be unknown, to a Bell state. The setup involves two linear optical circuits processing the individual photons and a parity gate working with weak cross-Kerr nonlinearity. By the photon number resolving detection on one of the output quantum bus or communication beams, the setup will realize a near deterministic transformation to a Bell state for every entangling attempt. With the simple threshold detectors, on the other hand, the system can still reach a considerable success probability of 0.5 per try. The decoherence effect caused by photon absorption losses in the operation is also discussed.

**31.    Suppression of non-adiabatic phases by a non-Markovian environment: easier observation of Berry phases**  
Robert S. Whitney  
Phys. Rev. A 81, 032108 (2010)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0806.4897  
<blockquote>
<p>
We consider a two-level system coupled to a highly non-Markovian environment when the coupling axis rotates with time. The environment may be quantum (for example a bosonic bath or a spin bath) or classical (such as classical noise). We show that an Anderson orthogonality catastrophe suppresses transitions, so that the system's instantaneous eigenstates (parallel and anti-parallel to the coupling axis) can adiabatically follow the rotation. These states thereby acquire Berry phases; geometric phases given by the area enclosed by the coupling axis. Unlike in earlier proposals for environment-induced Berry phases, here there is little decoherence, so one does not need a decoherence-free subspace. Indeed we show that this Berry phase should be much easier to observe than a conventional one, because it is not masked by either the dynamic phase or the leading non-adiabatic phase. The effects that we discuss should be observable in any qubit device where one can drive three parameters in the Hamiltonian with strong man-made noise.

Europhys. Lett. 83, 47011 (2008)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0806.0942  
<blockquote>
<p>
We propose to detect the Mott insulator-superfluid quantum phase transition in an array of coupled cavities by studying the polariton and photon fluctuations in a block of linear dimension M (in units of the lattice constant of the array). We explicitly show this for a one-dimensional array; the analysis can be however extended to higher dimensions. In the Mott phase polariton fluctuations are independent of the block size. In the superfluid phase they grow logarithmically with M, the prefactor being related to the compressibility of the system. In the case of photon fluctuations, the critical behaviour is encoded in the subleading scaling with the block dimension, while the leading behaviour is linear in M and non-critical. Our results have been obtained by means of the density matrix renormalization group numerical algorithm.

Eurphys. Lett. 85, 37001 (2009)

<blockquote>
<p>
We show that, when a finite anisotropic Heisenberg spin-1/2 chain in the gapped regime is driven far from equilibrium, oppositely polarized ferromagnetic domains build up at the edges of the chain, thus suppressing quantum spin transport. As a consequence, a negative differential conductivity regime arises, where increasing the driving decreases the current. The above results are explained in terms of magnon localization and are shown to be structurally stable against breaking of integrability.

<blockquote>
<p>
Using the method of canonical group quantization, we construct the angular momentum operators associated to configuration spaces with the topology of (i) a sphere and (ii) a projective plane. In the first case, the obtained angular momentum operators are the quantum version of Poincare's vector, i.e., the physically correct angular momentum operators for an electron coupled to the field of a magnetic monopole. In the second case, the obtained operators represent the angular momentum operators of a system of two indistinguishable spin zero quantum particles in three spatial dimensions. We explicitly show how our formalism relates to the one developed by Berry and Robbins. The relevance of the proposed formalism for an advance in our understanding of the spin-statistics connection in non-relativistic quantum mechanics is discussed.
