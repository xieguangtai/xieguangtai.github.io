**1.    Equivalence of the measures of non-Markovianty for open two-level systems**  
Hao-Sheng Zeng, Ning Tang, Yan-Ping Zheng, Guo-You Wang  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1104.0070  
<blockquote>
<p>
In order to depict the deviation of quantum time evolution in open systems from Markovian processes, different measures have been presented. We demonstrate that the measure proposed by Breuer, Laine and Piilo [Phys. Rev. Lett. 103, 210401 (2009)] and the two measures proposed by Rivas, Huelga and Plenio [Phys. Rev. Lett. 105, 050403 (2010)] have exactly the same non-Markovian time-evolution intervals and thus are really equivalent each other when they apply to open two-level systems coupled to environments via Jaynes-Cummings or dephasing models. This equivalence implies that the three measures in different ways capture the intrinsical characters of non-Markovianty of quantum evolutional processes. We also show that the maximization in the definition of the first measure can be actually removed for the considered models without influencing the sensibility of the measure to detect non-Markovianty.

**2.    Zitterbewegung, Bloch Oscillations and Landau-Zener Tunneling in a Quantum Walk**  
Alois Regensburger, Christoph Bersch, Benjamin Hinrichs, Georgy Onishchukov, Andreas Schreiber, Christine Silberhorn, Ulf Peschel  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1104.0105  
<blockquote>
<p>
We experimentally investigate a discrete time quantum walk in a system of coupled fiber loops and observe typical phenomena known from the wave propagation in periodic structures as ballistic spreading or an oscillation between two internal quantum states similar to Zitterbewegung (trembling motion). If a position-dependent phase gradient is applied we find localization and Bloch oscillations of the field for moderate as well as Landau-Zener tunneling for strong phase gradients.

**3.    Quantum light by atomic arrays in optical resonators**  
Hessam Habibian, Stefano Zippilli, Giovanna Morigi  
Phys. Rev. A 84, 033829 (2011)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1104.0182  
<blockquote>
<p>
Light scattering by a periodic atomic array is studied when the atoms couple with the mode of a high-finesse optical resonator and are driven by a laser. When the von-Laue condition is not satified, there is no coherent emission into the cavity mode, and the latter is pumped via inelastic scattering processes. We consider this situation and identify conditions for which different non-linear optical processes can occur. We show that these processes can be controlled by suitably tuning the strength of laser and cavity coupling, the angle between laser and cavity axis, and the array periodicity. We characterize the coherence properties of the light when the system can either operate as degenerate parametric amplifier or as a source of antibunched-light. Our study permits us to identify the individual multi-photon components of the nonlinear optical response of the atomic array and the corresponding parameter regimes, thereby in principle allowing one for controlling the nonlinear optical response of the medium.

**4.    QuECT: A New Quantum Programming Paradigm**  
Arnab Chakraborty  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1104.0497  
<blockquote>
<p>
Quantum computation constitutes a rapidly expanding subfield of computer science. Development quantum algorithms is facilitated by the availability of efficient quantum programming languages, and a plethora of approaches has been already suggested in the literature, ranging from GUI-based simple tools to elaborate standalone programming languages. In this paper we propose a novel paradigm called Quantum Embeddable Circuit Technique (QuECT) that allows a programmer to embed a circuit diagram in a classical "host" language. The paradigm can be implemented in any modern classical language. A prototype has been developed by the author using Java.

**5.    Symmetry and Quantum Transport on Networks**  
S. Salimi, R. Radgohar, M. M. Soltanzadeh  
International Journal of Quantum Information Vol. 8, No. 8 (2010) 1323-1335  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1104.0596  
<blockquote>
<p>
We study the classical and quantum transport processes on some finite networks and model them by continuous-time random walks (CTRW) and continuous-time quantum walks (CTQW), respectively. We calculate the classical and quantum transition probabilities between two nodes of the network. We numerically show that there is a high probability to find the walker at the initial node for CTQWs on the underlying networks due to the interference phenomenon, even for long times. To get global information (independent of the starting node) about the transport efficiency, we average the return probability over all nodes of the network. We apply the decay rate and the asymptotic value of the average of the return probability to evaluate the transport efficiency. Our numerical results prove that the existence of the symmetry in the underlying networks makes quantum transport less efficient than the classical one. In addition, we find that the increasing of the symmetry of these networks decreases the efficiency of quantum transport on them.

**6.    Bipartite entangled stabilizer mutually unbiased bases as maximum cliques of Cayley graphs**  
Wim van Dam, Mark Howard  
Phys. Rev. A 84, 012117 (2011)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1104.0945  
<blockquote>
<p>
We examine the existence and structure of particular sets of mutually unbiased bases (MUBs) in bipartite qudit systems. In contrast to well-known power-of-prime MUB constructions, we restrict ourselves to using maximally entangled stabilizer states as MUB vectors. Consequently, these bipartite entangled stabilizer MUBs (BES MUBs) provide no local information, but are sufficient and minimal for decomposing a wide variety of interesting operators including (mixtures of) Jamiolkowski states, entanglement witnesses and more. The problem of finding such BES MUBs can be mapped, in a natural way, to that of finding maximum cliques in a family of Cayley graphs. Some relationships with known power-of-prime MUB constructions are discussed, and observables for BES MUBs are given explicitly in terms of Pauli operators.

**7.    Non-Markovian dynamical effects and time evolution of entanglement entropy of a dissipative two-state system**  
Zhiguo Lü, H. Zheng  
EPL, 86 (2009) 60009  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1104.1752  
<blockquote>
<p>
We investigate the dynamical information exchange between a two-state system and its environment which is measured by von Neumann entropy. It is found that in the underdamping regime, the entropy dynamics exhibits an extremely non-Markovian oscillation-hump feature, in which oscillations manifest quantum coherence and a hump of envelop demonstrates temporal memory of bath. It indicates that the process of entropy exchange is bidirectional. When the coupling strength increases a certain threshold, the hump along with ripple disappears, which is indicative of the coherent-incoherent dynamical crossover. The long-time limit of entropy evolution reaches the ground state value which agrees with that of numerical renormalization group.

**9.    Brun-Type Formalism for Decoherence in Two Dimensional Quantum Walks**  
Clement Ampadu  
Communications in Theoretical Physics (2012),Volume 57, Number 1, pp 41-55  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1104.2061  
<blockquote>
<p>
We study decoherence in the quantum walk on the xy-plane. We generalize the method of decoherent coin quantum walk, introduced by [T.A. Brun, et.al, Phys.Rev.A 67 (2003) 032304],which could be applicable to all sorts of decoherence in two dimensional quantum walks, irrespective of the unitary transformation governing the walk. As an application we study decoherence in the presence of broken line noise in which the quantum walk is governed by the two-dimensional Hadamard operator.

**11.    Asymptotic evolution of quantum walks on the $N$-cycle subject to decoherence on both the coin and position degrees of freedom**  
Chaobin Liu, Nelson Petulante  
Phys. Rev. A 84, 012317 (2011)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1104.2653  
<blockquote>
<p>
Consider a discrete-time quantum walk on the $N$-cycle subject to decoherence both on the coin and the position degrees of freedom. By examining the evolution of the density matrix of the system, we derive some new conclusions about the asymptotic behavior of the system. When $N$ is odd, the density matrix of the system tends, in the long run, to the maximally mixed state, independent of the initial state. When $N$ is even, although the behavior of the system is not necessarily asymptotically stationary, in this case too an explicit formulation is obtained of the asymptotic dynamics of the system. Moreover, this approach enables us to specify the limiting behavior of the mutual information, viewed as a measure of quantum entanglement between subsystems (coin and walker). In particular, our results provide efficient theoretical confirmation of the findings of previous authors, who arrived at their results through extensive numerical simulations. Our results can be attributed to an important theorem which, for a generalized random unitary operation, explicitly identifies the structure of all of its eigenspaces corresponding to eigenvalues of unit modulus.

**12.    Realizing Physical Approximation of the Partial Transpose**  
Hyang-Tag Lim, Yong-Su Kim, Young-Sik Ra, Joonwoo Bae, Yoon-Ho Kim  
Phys. Rev. Lett. 107, 160401(2011)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1104.3039  
<blockquote>
<p>
The partial transpose by which a subsystem's quantum state is solely transposed is of unique importance in quantum information processing from both fundamental and practical point of view. In this work, we present a practical scheme to realize a physical approximation to the partial transpose using local measurements on individual quantum systems and classical communication. We then report its linear optical realization and show that the scheme works with no dependence on local basis of given quantum states. A proof-of-principle demonstration of entanglement detection using the physical approximation of the partial transpose is also reported.

J. Feist, S. Nagele, C. Ticknor, B. I. Schneider, L. A. Collins, J. Burgd?rfer  
Phys. Rev. Lett. 107, 093005 (2011)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1104.3798  
<blockquote>
<p>
We show that the correlation dynamics in coherently excited doubly excited resonances of helium can be followed in real time by two-photon interferometry. This approach promises to map the evolution of the two-electron wave packet onto experimentally easily accessible non-coincident single electron spectra. We analyze the interferometric signal in terms of a semi-analytical model which is validated by a numerical solution of the time-dependent two-electron Schr\"odinger equation in its full dimensionality.

<p>
We propose an implementation scheme for the continuous-time quantum walk using a diatomic molecule and an optical frequency comb. We show an analogy between the quantum walk and the cascade rotational transitions induced by the optical frequency comb whose frequency peaks are tuned to the pure rotational transitions in the molecule. The strategy to compensate for the centrifugal distortion of the real molecule is also demonstrated.

**18.    Quantum dynamical maps and Markovianity**  
A. R. Usha Devi, A. K. Rajagopal, Sudha  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1104.4566  
<blockquote>
<p>
It is known that the time evolution of a subsystem from an initial state to two later times, t1, t2 (t2 > t1), are both completely positive (CP) but it is shown here that in the intermediate times between t1 and t2, in general, it need not be CP. This reveals the key to the Markov (if CP) and nonMarkov (if NCP) avataras of the intermediate dynamics. This is brought out based on A and B dynamical maps - without resorting to Master equation approach. The choice of tensor product form for the global initial state points towards the system-environment interaction dynamics as the sole cause for Markovianity/non-Markovianity. A succinct summary of the results is given in the form of a table.

**19.    Average and instantaneous velocities of energy of evanescent modes**  
Zhi-Yong Wang, Wen-Chao Wang, Qi Qiu, Cai-Dong Xiong, Liu Yong  
Phys. Rev. A 83, 053827 (2011)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1104.4614  
<blockquote>
<p>
Many theoretical and experimental investigations have presented a conclusion that evanescent electromagnetic modes can superluminally propagate. However, in this paper, we show that the average energy velocity of evanescent modes inside a cut-off waveguide is always less than or equal to the velocity of light in vacuum, while the instantaneous energy velocity can be superluminal, which does not violate causality according to quantum field theory: the fact that a particle can propagate over a space-like interval does preserve causality provided that here a measurement performed at one point cannot affect another measurement at a point separated from the first with a space-like interval.

Phys. Lett. A, 375:3255-3258 (2011)

<blockquote>
<p>
We investigate an efficient quantum error correction of a fully correlated noise. Suppose the noise is characterized by a quantum channel whose error operators take fully correlated forms given by $\sigma_x^{\otimes n}$, $\sigma_y^{\otimes n}$ and $\sigma_z^{\otimes n}$, where $n>2$ is the number of qubits encoding the codeword. It is proved that (i) $n$ qubits codeword encodes $(n-1)$ data qubits when $n$ is odd and (ii) $n$ qubits codeword implements a noiseless subsystem encoding $(n-2)$ data qubits when $n$ is even. Quantum circuits implementing these schemes are constructed.

**21.    Adaptively correcting quantum errors with entanglement**  
Yuichiro Fujiwara, Min-Hsiu Hsieh  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1104.5004  
<blockquote>
<p>
Contrary to the assumption that most quantum error-correcting codes (QECC) make, it is expected that phase errors are much more likely than bit errors in physical devices. By employing the entanglement-assisted stabilizer formalism, we develop a new kind of error-correcting protocol which can flexibly trade error correction abilities between the two types of errors, such that high error correction performance is achieved both in symmetric and in asymmetric situations. The characteristics of the QECCs can be optimized in an adaptive manner during information transmission. The proposed entanglement-assisted QECCs require only one ebit regardless of the degree of asymmetry at a given moment and can be decoded in polynomial time.

**22.    Universal dynamical decoupling of multiqubit states from environment**  
Liang Jiang, Adilet Imambekov  
Phys. Rev. A 84, 060302(R) (2011)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1104.5021  
<blockquote>
<p>
We study the dynamical decoupling of multiqubit states from environment. For a system of m qubits, the nested Uhrig dynamical decoupling (NUDD) sequence can efficiently suppress generic decoherence induced by system-environment interaction to order N using (N+1)^2m pulses. We prove that the NUDD sequence is universal, i.e., it can restore the coherence of m-qubit quantum system independent of the details of system-environment interaction. We also construct a general mapping between dynamical decoupling problems and discrete quantum walks in certain functional spaces.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1104.5263  
<blockquote>
<p>
The channel induced by a complex system interacting strongly with a qubit is calculated exactly under the assumption of randomness of its eigenvectors. The resulting channel is represented as an isotropic time dependent oscillation of the Bloch ball, leading to non-Markovian behavior, even in the limit of infinite environments. Two contributions are identified: one due to the density of states and the other due to correlations in the spectrum. Prototype examples, one for chaotic and the other for regular dynamics are explored.

<p>
It is well known that the quantum Zeno effect can protect specific quantum states from decoherence by using projective measurements. Here we combine the theory of weak measurements with stabilizer quantum error correction and detection codes. We derive rigorous performance bounds which demonstrate that the Zeno effect can be used to protect appropriately encoded arbitrary states to arbitrary accuracy, while at the same time allowing for universal quantum computation or quantum control.

**26.    Nonequilibrium work on spin glasses in longitudinal and transverse fields**  
Masayuki Ohzeki, Hitoshi Katsuda, Hidetoshi Nishimori  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1104.0484  
<blockquote>
<p>
We derive a number of exact relations between equilibrium and nonequilibrium quantities for spin glasses in external fields using the Jarzynski equality and gauge symmetry. For randomly-distributed longitudinal fields, a lower bound is established for the work done on the system in nonequilibrium processes, and identities are proven to relate equilibrium and nonequilibrium quantities. In the case of uniform transverse fields, identities are proven between physical quantities and exponentiated work done to the system at different parts of the phase diagram with the context of quantum annealing in mind. Additional relations are given, which relate the exponentiated work in quantum and simulated (classical) annealing. It is also suggested that the Jarzynski equality may serve as a guide to develop a method to perform quantum annealing under non-adiabatic conditions.

**27.    Probing vacuum birefringence by phase-contrast Fourier imaging under fields of high-intensity lasers**  
Kensuke Homma, Dieter Habs, Toshiki Tajima  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1104.0994  
<blockquote>
<p>
In vacuum high-intensity lasers can cause photon-photon interaction via the process of virtual vacuum polarization which may be measured by the phase velocity shift of photons across intense fields. In the optical frequency domain, the photon-photon interaction is polarization-mediated described by the Euler-Heisenberg effective action. This theory predicts the vacuum birefringence or polarization dependence of the phase velocity shift arising from nonlinear properties in quantum electrodynamics (QED). We suggest a method to measure the vacuum birefringence under intense optical laser fields based on the absolute phase velocity shift by phase-contrast Fourier imaging. The method may serve for observing effects even beyond the QED vacuum polarization.

Int.J.Mod.Phys.B25:171-230,2011  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1104.1705  
<blockquote>
<p>
We describe experimental and related theoretical work on the measurement of the Casimir force using semiconductor test bodies. This field of research started in 2005 and several important and interesting results have already been obtained. Specifically, the Casimir force or its gradient were measured in the configuration of an Au-coated sphere and different semiconductor surfaces. It was found that the force magnitude depends significantly on the replacement of the metal with a semiconductor and on the concentration of charge carriers in the semiconductor material. Special attention is paid to the experiment on the optical modulation of the Casimir force. In this experiment the difference Casimir force between an Au-coated sphere and Si plate in the presence and in the absence of laser light was measured. Possible applications of this experiment are discussed, specifically, for the realization of the pulsating Casimir force in three-layer systems. Theoretical problems arising from the comparison of the experimental data for the difference Casimir force with the Lifshitz theory are analyzed. We consider the possibility to control the magnitude of the Casimir force in phase transitions of semiconductor materials. Experiments on measuring the Casimir force gradient between an Au-coated sphere and Si plate covered with rectangular corrugations of different character are also described. Here, we discuss the interplay between the material properties and nontrivial geometry and the applicability of the proximity force approximation. The review contains comparison between different experiments and analysis of their advantages and disadvantages.

<p>
We consider the interaction of electromagnetic radiation of arbitrary polarization with multi-level atoms in a self-consistent manner, taking into account both spatial and temporal dependencies of local fields. This is done by numerically solving the corresponding system of coupled Maxwell-Liouville equations for various geometries. In particular, we scrutinize linear optical properties of nanoscale atomic clusters, demonstrating the significant role played by collective effects and dephasing. It is shown that subwavelength atomic clusters exhibit two resonant modes, one of which is localized slightly below the atomic transition frequency of an individual atom, while the other is positioned considerably above it. As an initial exploration of future applications of this approach, the optical response of core-shell nanostructures, with a core consisting of silver and shell composed of resonant atoms, is examined.

Hans J. Briegel, Gemma De las Cuevas  
Sci. Rep. 2, 400 (2012)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1104.3787  
<blockquote>
<p>
We propose a model of a learning agent whose interaction with the environment is governed by a simulation-based projection, which allows the agent to project itself into future situations before it takes real action. Projective simulation is based on a random walk through a network of clips, which are elementary patches of episodic memory. The network of clips changes dynamically, both due to new perceptual input and due to certain compositional principles of the simulation process. During simulation, the clips are screened for specific features which trigger factual action of the agent. The scheme is different from other, computational, notions of simulation, and it provides a new element in an embodied cognitive science approach to intelligent action and learning. Our model provides a natural route for generalization to quantum-mechanical operation and connects the fields of reinforcement learning and quantum computation.

Prog. Theor. Phys. 126(3) (2011), 419-434  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1104.4330  
<blockquote>
<p>
In this paper, whose aims are mainly pedagogical, we illustrate how to use the local zeta regularization to compute the stress-energy tensor of the Casimir effect. Our attention is devoted to the case of a neutral, massless scalar field in flat space-time, on a space domain with suitable (e.g., Dirichlet) boundary conditions. After a simple outline of the local zeta method, we exemplify it in the typical case of a field between two parallel plates, or outside them. The results are shown to agree with the ones obtained by more popular methods, such as point splitting regularization. In comparison with these alternative methods, local zeta regularization has the advantage to give directly finite results via analitic continuation, with no need to remove or subtract divergent quantities.
